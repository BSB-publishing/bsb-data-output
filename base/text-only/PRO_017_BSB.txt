Better a dry morsel in quietness
A wise servant will rule over a disgraceful son
A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold,
A wicked man listens to evil lips;
He who mocks the poor insults their Maker;
Grandchildren are the crown of the aged,
Eloquent words are unfit for a fool;
A bribe is a charm to its giver;
Whoever conceals an offense promotes love,
A rebuke cuts into a man of discernment
An evil man seeks only rebellion;
It is better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs
If anyone returns evil for good,
To start a quarrel is to release a flood;
Acquitting the guilty and condemning the righteous—
Why should the fool have money in his hand
A friend loves at all times,
A man lacking judgment strikes hands in pledge
He who loves transgression loves strife;
The one with a perverse heart finds no good,
A man fathers a fool to his own grief;
A joyful heart is good medicine,
A wicked man takes a covert bribe
Wisdom is the focus of the discerning,
A foolish son brings grief to his father
It is surely not good to punish the innocent
A man of knowledge restrains his words,
Even a fool is considered wise if he keeps silent,
