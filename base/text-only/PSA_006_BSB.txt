For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments, according to Sheminith.
Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am frail;
My soul is deeply distressed.
Turn, O LORD, and deliver my soul;
For there is no mention of You in death;
I am weary from groaning;
My eyes fail from grief;
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,
The LORD has heard my cry for mercy;
All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed;
