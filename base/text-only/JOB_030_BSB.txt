“But now they mock me,
What use to me was the strength of their hands,
Gaunt from poverty and hunger,
They plucked mallow among the shrubs,
They were banished from among men,
so that they lived on the slopes of the wadis,
They cried out among the shrubs
A senseless and nameless brood,
And now they mock me in song;
They abhor me and keep far from me;
Because God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me,
The rabble arises at my right;
They tear up my path;
They advance as through a wide breach;
Terrors are turned loose against me;
And now my soul is poured out within me;
Night pierces my bones,
With great force He grasps my garment;
He throws me into the mud,
I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer;
You have ruthlessly turned on me;
You snatch me up into the wind
Yes, I know that You will bring me down to death,
Yet no one stretches out his hand against a ruined man
Have I not wept for those in trouble?
But when I hoped for good, evil came;
I am churning within and cannot rest;
I go about blackened, but not by the sun.
I have become a brother of jackals,
My skin grows black and peels,
My harp is tuned to mourning
