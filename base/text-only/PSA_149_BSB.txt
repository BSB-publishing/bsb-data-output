Hallelujah!
Let Israel rejoice in their Maker;
Let them praise His name with dancing,
For the LORD takes pleasure in His people;
Let the saints exult in glory;
May the high praises of God be in their mouths,
to inflict vengeance on the nations
to bind their kings with chains
to execute the judgment written against them.
