Dishonest scales are an abomination to the LORD,
When pride comes, disgrace follows,
The integrity of the upright guides them,
Riches are worthless in the day of wrath,
The righteousness of the blameless directs their path,
The righteousness of the upright delivers them,
When the wicked man dies, his hope perishes,
The righteous man is delivered from trouble;
With his mouth the ungodly man destroys his neighbor,
When the righteous thrive, the city rejoices,
By the blessing of the upright a city is built up,
Whoever shows contempt for his neighbor lacks judgment,
A gossip reveals a secret,
For lack of guidance, a nation falls,
He who puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer,
A gracious woman attains honor,
A kind man benefits himself,
The wicked man earns an empty wage,
Genuine righteousness leads to life,
The perverse in heart are an abomination to the LORD,
Be assured that the wicked will not go unpunished,
Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout
The desire of the righteous leads only to good,
One gives freely, yet gains even more;
A generous soul will prosper,
The people will curse the hoarder of grain,
He who searches out good finds favor,
He who trusts in his riches will fall,
He who brings trouble on his house will inherit the wind,
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,
If the righteous receive their due on earth,
