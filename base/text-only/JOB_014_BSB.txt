“Man, who is born of woman,
Like a flower, he comes forth, then withers away;
Do You open Your eyes to one like this?
Who can bring out clean from unclean?
Since his days are determined
look away from him and let him rest,
For there is hope for a tree:
If its roots grow old in the ground
at the scent of water it will bud
But a man dies and is laid low;
As water disappears from the sea
so a man lies down
If only You would hide me in Sheol
When a man dies, will he live again?
You will call, and I will answer;
For then You would count my steps,
My transgression would be sealed in a bag,
But as a mountain erodes and crumbles
as water wears away the stones
You forever overpower him, and he passes on;
If his sons receive honor, he does not know it;
He feels only the pain of his own body
