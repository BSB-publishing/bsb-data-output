I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and He said:
Though they dig down to Sheol,
Though they hide themselves atop Carmel,
Though they are driven by their enemies into captivity,
The Lord GOD of Hosts,
He builds His upper rooms in the heavens
“Are you not like the Cushites
Surely the eyes of the Lord GOD
“For surely I will give the command,
All the sinners among My people
“In that day I will restore
that they may possess the remnant of Edom
“Behold, the days are coming,”
I will restore My people Israel from captivity;
I will firmly plant them in their own land,
