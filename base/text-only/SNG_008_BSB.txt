O that you were to me like a brother
I would lead you and bring you
His left hand is under my head,
O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you:
Who is this coming up from the wilderness,
Set me as a seal over your heart,
Mighty waters cannot quench love;
We have a little sister,
If she is a wall,
I am a wall,
Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-hamon.
But my own vineyard is mine to give;
You who dwell in the gardens,
Come away, my beloved,
