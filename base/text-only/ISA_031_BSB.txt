Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,
Yet He too is wise and brings disaster;
But the Egyptians are men, not God;
For this is what the LORD has said to me:
Like birds hovering overhead,
Return to the One against whom you have so blatantly rebelled, O children of Israel.
For on that day, every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold that your own hands have sinfully made.
“Then Assyria will fall,
Their rock will pass away for fear,
