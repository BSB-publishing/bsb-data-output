Israel was a luxuriant vine,
Their hearts are devious;
Surely now they will say,
They speak mere words;
The people of Samaria will fear
Yes, it will be carried to Assyria
Samaria will be carried off with her king
The high places of Aven
Since the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel,
I will chasten them when I please;
Ephraim is a well-trained heifer that loves to thresh;
Sow for yourselves righteousness
You have plowed wickedness and reaped injustice;
the roar of battle will rise against your people,
Thus it will be done to you, O Bethel,
