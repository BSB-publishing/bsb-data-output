The point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
and who ministers in the sanctuary and true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man.
And since every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, it was necessary for this One also to have something to offer.
Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer gifts according to the law.
The place where they serve is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”
Now, however, Jesus has received a much more excellent ministry, just as the covenant He mediates is better and is founded on better promises.
For if that first  covenant had been without fault, no place would have been sought for a second.
But God found fault with the people and said:
It will not be like the covenant
For this is the covenant I will make
No longer will each one teach his neighbor or his brother,
For I will forgive their iniquities
By speaking of a new covenant,
