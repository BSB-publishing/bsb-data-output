For the choirmaster. To the tune of “A Dove on Distant Oaks.” A Miktam
My enemies pursue me all day long,
When I am afraid,
In God, whose word I praise —
All day long they twist my words;
They conspire, they lurk,
In spite of such sin, will they escape?
You have taken account of my wanderings.
Then my enemies will retreat
In God, whose word I praise,
in God I trust; I will not be afraid.
Your vows are upon me, O God;
For You have delivered my soul from death,
