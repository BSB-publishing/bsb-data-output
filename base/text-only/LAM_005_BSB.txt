Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us.
Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
We have become fatherless orphans;
We must buy the water we drink;
We are closely pursued;
We submitted to Egypt and Assyria
Our fathers sinned and are no more,
Slaves rule over us;
We get our bread at the risk of our lives
Our skin is as hot as an oven
Women have been ravished in Zion,
Princes have been hung up by their hands;
Young men toil at millstones;
The elders have left the city gate;
Joy has left our hearts;
The crown has fallen from our head.
Because of this, our hearts are faint;
because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate,
You, O LORD, reign forever;
Why have You forgotten us forever?
Restore us to Yourself, O LORD, so we may return;
unless You have utterly rejected us
