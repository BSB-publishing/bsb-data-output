This is the message that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
In the last days the mountain of the house of the LORD
And many peoples will come and say:
Then He will judge between the nations
Come, O house of Jacob,
For You have abandoned Your people,
Their land is full of silver and gold,
Their land is full of idols;
So mankind is brought low,
Go into the rocks
The proud look of man will be humbled,
For the Day of the LORD of Hosts
against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up,
against all the tall mountains,
against every high tower,
against every ship of Tarshish,
So the pride of man will be brought low,
and the idols will vanish completely.
Men will flee to caves in the rocks
In that day men will cast away
They will flee to caverns in the rocks
Put no more trust in man,
