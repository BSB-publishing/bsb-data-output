For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
both low and high,
My mouth will impart wisdom,
I will incline my ear to a proverb;
Why should I fear in times of trouble,
They trust in their wealth
No man can possibly redeem his brother
For the redemption of his soul is costly,
that he should live on forever
For it is clear that wise men die,
Their graves
But a man, despite his wealth, cannot endure;
This is the fate of the foolish
Like sheep they are destined for Sheol.
But God will redeem my life from Sheol,
Do not be afraid when a man grows rich,
For when he dies, he will carry nothing away;
Though in his lifetime he blesses his soul —
he will join the generation of his fathers,
A man who has riches without understanding
