“At this my heart also pounds
Listen closely to the thunder of His voice
He unleashes His lightning beneath the whole sky
Then there comes a roaring sound;
God thunders wondrously with His voice;
For He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’
He seals up the hand of every man,
The wild animals enter their lairs;
The tempest comes from its chamber,
By the breath of God the ice is formed
He loads the clouds with moisture;
They swirl about,
Whether for punishment or for His land,
Listen to this, O Job;
Do you know how God dispatches the clouds
Do you understand how the clouds float,
You whose clothes get hot
can you, like Him, spread out the skies,
Teach us what we should say to Him;
Should He be told that I want to speak?
Now no one can gaze at the sun
Out of the north He comes in golden splendor;
The Almighty is beyond our reach;
Therefore, men fear Him,
