Jesus also said to His disciples,
So he called him in to ask, ‘What is this I hear about you? Turn in an account of your management, for you cannot be manager any longer.’
I know what I will do so that after my removal from management, people will welcome me into their homes.’
I tell you, use worldly wealth to make friends for yourselves so that when it is gone, they will welcome you into eternal dwellings.
So if you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will entrust you with true riches?
And if you have not been faithful with the belongings of another, who will give you belongings of your own?
The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all of this and were scoffing at Jesus.
So He said to them,
But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for a single stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.
And a beggar named Lazarus lay at his gate, covered with sores
and longing to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham from afar, with Lazarus by his side.
And besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that even those who wish cannot cross from here to you, nor can anyone cross from there to us.’
for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also end up in this place of torment.’
