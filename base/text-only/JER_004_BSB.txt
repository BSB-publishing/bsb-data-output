“If you will return, O Israel,
and if you can swear, ‘As surely as the LORD lives,’
For this is what the LORD says to the men of Judah and Jerusalem:
Circumcise yourselves to the LORD,
Announce in Judah, proclaim in Jerusalem, and say:
Raise a signal flag toward Zion.
A lion has gone up from his thicket,
So put on sackcloth,
“In that day,” declares the LORD,
Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD, how completely You have deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying, ‘You will have peace,’ while a sword is at our throats.”
At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A searing wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward the daughter of My people, but not to winnow or to sift;
a wind too strong for that comes from Me. Now I also pronounce judgments against them.”
Behold, he advances like the clouds,
Wash the evil from your heart, O Jerusalem,
For a voice resounds from Dan,
Warn the nations now!
They surround her like men guarding a field,
“Your ways and deeds
My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain!
Disaster after disaster is proclaimed,
How long must I see the signal flag
“For My people are fools;
I looked at the earth,
I looked at the mountains,
I looked, and no man was left;
I looked, and the fruitful land was a desert.
For this is what the LORD says:
Therefore the earth will mourn
Every city flees
And you, O devastated one, what will you do,
For I hear a cry like a woman in labor,
