For the choirmaster. A song. A Psalm.
Sing the glory of His name;
Say to God, “How awesome are Your deeds!
All the earth bows down to You;
Come and see the works of God;
He turned the sea into dry land;
He rules forever by His power;
Bless our God, O peoples;
He preserves our lives
For You , O God, have tested us;
You led us into the net;
You let men ride over our heads;
I will enter Your house with burnt offerings;
the vows that my lips promised
I will offer You fatlings as burnt offerings,
Come and listen, all you who fear God,
I cried out to Him with my mouth
If I had cherished iniquity in my heart,
But God has surely heard;
Blessed be God, who has not rejected my prayer
