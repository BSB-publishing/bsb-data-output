A Psalm of David.
Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name;
The voice of the LORD is over the waters;
The voice of the LORD is powerful;
The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars;
He makes Lebanon skip like a calf,
The voice of the LORD
The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness;
The voice of the LORD twists the oaks
The LORD sits enthroned over the flood;
The LORD gives His people strength;
