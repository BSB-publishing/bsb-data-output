And Job continued his discourse:
“How I long for the months gone by,
when His lamp shone above my head,
when I was in my prime,
when the Almighty was still with me
when my steps were bathed in cream
When I went out to the city gate
the young men saw me and withdrew,
The princes refrained from speaking
The voices of the nobles were hushed,
For those who heard me called me blessed,
because I rescued the poor who cried out
The dying man blessed me,
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me;
I served as eyes to the blind
I was a father to the needy,
I shattered the fangs of the unjust
So I thought: ‘I will die in my nest
My roots will spread out to the waters,
My glory is ever new within me,
Men listened to me with expectation,
After my words, they spoke no more;
They waited for me as for rain
If I smiled at them, they did not believe it;
I chose their course and presided as chief.
