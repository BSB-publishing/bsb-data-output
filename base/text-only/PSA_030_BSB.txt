A Psalm. A song for the dedication of the temple. Of David.
O LORD my God, I cried to You for help,
O LORD, You pulled me up from Sheol;
Sing to the LORD, O you His saints,
For His anger is fleeting,
In prosperity I said,
O LORD, You favored me;
To You, O LORD, I called,
“What gain is there in my bloodshed,
Hear me, O LORD, and have mercy;
You turned my mourning into dancing;
that my heart may sing Your praises and not be silent.
