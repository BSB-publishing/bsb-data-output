I love the LORD, for He has heard my voice —
Because He has inclined His ear to me,
The ropes of death entangled me;
Then I called on the name of the LORD:
The LORD is gracious and righteous;
The LORD preserves the simplehearted;
Return to your rest, O my soul,
For You have delivered my soul from death,
I will walk before the LORD
I believed, therefore I said,
In my alarm I said,
How can I repay the LORD
I will lift the cup of salvation
I will fulfill my vows to the LORD
Precious in the sight of the LORD
Truly, O LORD, I am Your servant;
I will offer to You a sacrifice of thanksgiving
I will fulfill my vows to the LORD
in the courts of the LORD’s house,
