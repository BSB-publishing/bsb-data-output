For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A song.
His tent is in Salem,
There He shattered the flaming arrows,
You are resplendent with light,
The valiant lie plundered; they sleep their last sleep.
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob,
You alone are to be feared.
From heaven You pronounced judgment,
when God rose up to judge,
Even the wrath of man shall praise You;
Make and fulfill your vows to the LORD your God;
He breaks the spirits of princes;
