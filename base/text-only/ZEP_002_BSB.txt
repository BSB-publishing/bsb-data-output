Gather yourselves, gather together,
before the decree takes effect
Seek the LORD, all you humble of the earth
For Gaza will be abandoned,
Woe to the dwellers of the seacoast,
So the seacoast will become a land of pastures,
The coast will belong to the remnant of the house of Judah;
“I have heard the reproach of Moab
Therefore, as surely as I live,”
This they shall have in return for their pride,
The LORD will be terrifying to them
“You too, O Cushites,
And He will stretch out His hand against the north
Herds will lie down in her midst,
This carefree city
