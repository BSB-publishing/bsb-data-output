Of David.
He is my steadfast love and my fortress,
O LORD, what is man, that You regard him,
Man is like a breath;
Part Your heavens, O LORD, and come down;
Flash forth Your lightning and scatter them;
Reach down from on high;
whose mouths speak falsehood,
I will sing to You a new song, O God;
to Him who gives victory to kings,
Set me free and rescue me
Then our sons will be like plants
Our storehouses will be full,
Our oxen will bear great loads.
Blessed are the people of whom this is so;
