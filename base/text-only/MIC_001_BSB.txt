This is the word of the LORD that came to Micah the Moreshite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah — what he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem:
Hear, O peoples, all of you;
For behold, the LORD comes forth
The mountains will melt beneath Him,
All this is for the transgression of Jacob
Therefore I will make Samaria
All her carved images will be smashed to pieces;
Because of this I will lament and wail;
For her wound is incurable;
Do not tell it in Gath;
Depart in shameful nakedness,
For the dwellers of Maroth
Harness your chariot horses,
Therefore, send farewell gifts
I will again bring a conqueror against you,
Shave yourselves bald and cut off your hair
