This is Solomon’s Song of Songs.
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!
The fragrance of your perfume is pleasing;
Take me away with you— let us hurry!
I am dark, yet lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem,
Do not stare because I am dark,
Tell me, O one I love,
If you do not know, O fairest of women,
I compare you, my darling,
Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments,
We will make you ornaments of gold,
While the king was at his table,
My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh
My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms
How beautiful you are, my darling!
How handsome you are, my beloved!
The beams of our house are cedars;
