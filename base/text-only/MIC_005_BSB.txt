Now, O daughter of troops,
But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
Therefore Israel will be abandoned
He will stand and shepherd His flock
And He will be our peace
And they will rule the land of Assyria with the sword,
Then the remnant of Jacob will be
Then the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations,
Your hand will be lifted over your foes,
“In that day,”
I will remove the cities of your land
I will cut the sorceries from your hand,
I will also cut off the carved images
I will root out the Asherah poles from your midst
I will take vengeance in anger and wrath
