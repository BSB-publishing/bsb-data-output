A wise son heeds his father’s discipline,
From the fruit of his lips a man enjoys good things,
He who guards his mouth protects his life,
The slacker craves yet has nothing,
The righteous hate falsehood,
Righteousness guards the man of integrity,
One pretends to be rich, but has nothing;
Riches may ransom a man’s life,
The light of the righteous shines brightly,
Arrogance leads only to strife,
Dishonest wealth will dwindle,
Hope deferred makes the heart sick,
He who despises instruction will pay the penalty,
The teaching
Good understanding wins favor,
Every prudent man acts with knowledge,
A wicked messenger falls into trouble,
Poverty and shame come to him who ignores discipline,
Desire fulfilled is sweet to the soul,
He who walks with the wise will become wise,
Disaster pursues sinners,
A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,
Abundant food is in the fallow ground of the poor,
He who spares the rod hates his son,
A righteous man eats to his heart’s content,
