Behold, a king will reign in righteousness,
Each will be like a shelter from the wind,
Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed,
The mind of the rash will know and understand,
No longer will a fool be called noble,
For a fool speaks foolishness;
The weapons of the scoundrel are destructive;
But a noble man makes honorable plans;
Stand up, you complacent women;
In a little more than a year you will tremble,
Shudder, you ladies of leisure;
Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields,
and for the land of my people,
For the palace will be forsaken,
until the Spirit is poured out
Then justice will inhabit the wilderness,
The work of righteousness will be peace;
Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place,
But hail will level the forest,
Blessed are those who sow beside abundant waters,
