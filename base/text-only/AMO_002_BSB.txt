This is what the LORD says:
So I will send fire against Moab
I will cut off the ruler of Moab
This is what the LORD says:
So I will send fire upon Judah
This is what the LORD says:
They trample on the heads of the poor
They lie down beside every altar
Yet it was I who destroyed
And I brought you up from the land of Egypt
I raised up prophets from your sons
“But you made the Nazirites drink wine
Behold, I am about to crush you in your place
Escape will fail the swift,
The archer will not stand his ground,
Even the bravest of mighty men
