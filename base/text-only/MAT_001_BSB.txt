This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Abraham was the father of Isaac,
Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar,
Ram was the father of Amminadab,
Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab,
and Jesse the father of David the king.
Solomon the father of Rehoboam,
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat,
Uzziah was the father of Jotham,
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh,
and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers
After the exile to Babylon:
Zerubbabel the father of Abiud,
Azor was the father of Zadok,
Eliud was the father of Eleazar,
and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary,
In all, then, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and was unwilling to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to divorce her quietly.
But after he had pondered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to embrace Mary as your wife, for the One conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
She will give birth to a Son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus,
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:
“Behold, the virgin will be with child
When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and embraced Mary as his wife.
But he had no union with her
