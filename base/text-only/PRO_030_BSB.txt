These are the words of Agur son of Jakeh — the burden that this man declared to Ithiel:
Surely I am the most ignorant of men,
I have not learned wisdom,
Who has ascended to heaven and come down?
Every word of God is flawless;
Do not add to His words,
Two things I ask of You —
Keep falsehood and deceitful words far from me.
Otherwise, I may have too much
Do not slander a servant to his master,
There is a generation of those who curse their fathers
There is a generation of those who are pure in their own eyes
There is a generation— how haughty are their eyes
there is a generation whose teeth are swords
The leech has two daughters:
Sheol,
As for the eye that mocks a father
There are three things too wonderful for me, four that I cannot understand:
the way of an eagle in the sky,
This is the way of an adulteress:
Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up:
a servant who becomes king,
an unloved woman who marries,
Four things on earth are small, yet they are exceedingly wise:
The ants are creatures of little strength, yet they store up their food in the summer;
the rock badgers
the locusts have no king, yet they all advance in formation;
and the lizard can be caught in one’s hands, yet it is found in the palaces of kings.
There are three things that are stately in their stride, and four that are impressive in their walk:
a lion, mighty among beasts, refusing to retreat before anything;
a strutting rooster;
If you have foolishly exalted yourself
For as the churning of milk yields butter,
