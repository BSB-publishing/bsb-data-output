Then Job answered:
“Truly then you are the people
But I also have a mind;
I am a laughingstock to my friends,
The one at ease scorns misfortune
The tents of robbers are safe,
But ask the animals, and they will instruct you;
Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you;
Which of all these does not know
The life of every living thing is in His hand,
Does not the ear test words
Wisdom is found with the elderly,
Wisdom and strength belong to God;
What He tears down cannot be rebuilt;
If He holds back the waters, they dry up,
True wisdom and power belong to Him.
He leads counselors away barefoot
He loosens the bonds placed by kings
He leads priests away barefoot
He deprives the trusted of speech
He pours out contempt on nobles
He reveals the deep things of darkness
He makes nations great and destroys them;
He deprives the earth’s leaders of reason
They grope in the darkness without light;
