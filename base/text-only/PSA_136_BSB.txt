Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good.
Give thanks to the God of gods.
Give thanks to the Lord of lords.
He alone does great wonders.
By His insight He made the heavens.
He spread out the earth upon the waters.
He made the great lights —
the sun to rule the day,
the moon and stars to govern the night.
He struck down the firstborn of Egypt
and brought Israel out from among them
with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.
He divided the Red Sea
and led Israel through the midst,
but swept
He led His people through the wilderness.
He struck down great kings
and slaughtered mighty kings—
Sihon king of the Amorites
and Og king of Bashan—
and He gave their land as an inheritance,
a heritage to His servant Israel.
He remembered us in our low estate
and freed us from our enemies.
He gives food to every creature.
Give thanks to the God of heaven!
