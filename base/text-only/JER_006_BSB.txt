“Run for cover, O sons of Benjamin;
Though she is beautiful and delicate,
Shepherds and their flocks
‘Prepare for battle against her;
Rise up, let us attack by night
For this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
As a well gushes its water,
Be forewarned, O Jerusalem,
This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
To whom can I give this warning?
But I am full of the LORD’s wrath;
Their houses will be turned over to others,
“For from the least of them to the greatest,
They dress the wound of My people
Are they ashamed of the abomination they have committed?
This is what the LORD says:
I appointed watchmen over you and said,
Therefore hear, O nations,
Hear, O earth! I am bringing disaster on this people,
What use to Me is frankincense from Sheba
Therefore this is what the LORD says:
This is what the LORD says:
They grasp the bow and spear;
We have heard the report;
Do not go out to the fields;
O daughter of my people,
“I have appointed you to examine My people like ore,
All are hardened rebels,
The bellows blow fiercely,
They are called rejected silver,
