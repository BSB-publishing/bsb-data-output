A Psalm of David.
May my prayer be set before You like incense;
Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth;
Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thing
Let the righteous man strike me;
When their rulers are thrown down from the cliffs,
As when one plows and breaks up the soil,
But my eyes are fixed on You,
Keep me from the snares they have laid for me,
Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
