This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you.
For behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will restore from captivity
These are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah.
Yes, this is what the LORD says:
Ask now, and see:
How awful that day will be!
On that day,
Instead, they will serve the LORD their God
As for you, O Jacob My servant, do not be afraid,
For I am with you to save you,
For this is what the LORD says:
There is no one to plead your cause,
All your lovers have forgotten you;
Why do you cry out over your wound?
Nevertheless, all who devour you will be devoured,
But I will restore your health and heal your wounds,
This is what the LORD says:
Thanksgiving will proceed from them,
Their children will be as in days of old,
Their leader will be one of their own,
“And you will be My people,
Behold, the storm of the LORD
The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back
