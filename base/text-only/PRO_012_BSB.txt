Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,
The good man obtains favor from the LORD,
A man cannot be established through wickedness,
A wife of noble character is her husband’s crown,
The plans of the righteous are just,
The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood,
The wicked are overthrown and perish,
A man is praised according to his wisdom,
Better to be lightly esteemed yet have a servant,
A righteous man regards the life of his animal,
The one who works his land will have plenty of food,
The wicked desire the plunder of evil men,
An evil man is trapped by his rebellious speech,
By fruitful speech a man is filled with good things,
The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,
A fool’s anger is known at once,
He who speaks the truth declares what is right,
Speaking rashly is like a piercing sword,
Truthful lips endure forever,
Deceit is in the hearts of those who devise evil,
No harm befalls the righteous,
Lying lips are detestable to the LORD,
A shrewd man keeps his knowledge to himself,
The hand of the diligent will rule,
Anxiety weighs down the heart of a man,
A righteous man is cautious in friendship,
A lazy man does not roast his game,
There is life in the path of righteousness,
