I
He has driven me away and made me walk
Indeed, He keeps turning His hand
He has worn away my flesh and skin;
He has besieged me and surrounded me
He has made me dwell in darkness
He has walled me in so I cannot escape;
Even when I cry out and plead for help,
He has barred my ways with cut stones;
He is a bear lying in wait,
He forced me off my path and tore me to pieces;
He bent His bow
He pierced my kidneys
I am a laughingstock to all my people;
He has filled me with bitterness;
He has ground my teeth with gravel
My soul has been deprived of peace;
So I say,  “My strength has perished,
Remember my affliction and wandering,
Surely my soul remembers
Yet I call this to mind,
Because of the loving devotion
They are new every morning;
“The LORD is my portion,” says my soul,
The LORD is good to those who wait for Him,
It is good to wait quietly
It is good for a man to bear the yoke
Let him sit alone in silence,
Let him bury his face in the dust—
Let him offer his cheek to the one who would strike him;
For the Lord will not
Even if He causes grief, He will show compassion
For He does not willingly afflict
To crush underfoot
to deny a man justice
to subvert a man in his lawsuit—
Who has spoken and it came to pass,
Do not both adversity and good
Why should any mortal man complain,
Let us examine and test our ways,
Let us lift up our hearts and hands
“We have sinned and rebelled;
You have covered Yourself in anger and pursued us;
You have covered Yourself with a cloud
You have made us scum and refuse
All our enemies
Panic and pitfall have come upon us —
Streams of tears flow from my eyes
My eyes overflow unceasingly,
until the LORD
My eyes bring grief to my soul
Without cause my enemies
They dropped me alive into a pit
The waters flowed over my head,
I called on Your name, O LORD,
You heard my plea:
You drew near when I called on You;
You defend my cause, O Lord;
You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me;
You have seen all their malice,
O LORD, You have heard their insults,
the slander and murmuring of my assailants
When they sit and when they rise,
You will pay them back what they deserve, O LORD,
Put a veil of anguish over their hearts;
You will pursue them in anger and exterminate them
