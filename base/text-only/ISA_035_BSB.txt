The wilderness and the dry land will be glad;
It will bloom profusely
Strengthen the limp hands
Say to those with anxious hearts:
Then the eyes of the blind will be opened
Then the lame will leap like a deer
The parched ground will become a pool,
And there will be a highway
No lion will be there,
So the redeemed of the LORD will return
