Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Now you, son of man, take up a lament for Tyre.
Tell Tyre, who dwells at the gateway to the sea, merchant of the peoples on many coasts, that this is what the Lord GOD says:
Your borders are in the heart of the seas;
They constructed all your planking
Of oaks from Bashan
Of embroidered fine linen from Egypt
The men of Sidon and Arvad
The elders of Gebal were aboard as shipwrights,
Men of Persia, Lydia, and Put
Men of Arvad and Helech
Tarshish was your merchant because of your great wealth of goods; they exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your wares.
Javan,
The men of Beth-togarmah exchanged horses, war horses, and mules for your wares.
The men of Dedan
Aram
Judah and the land of Israel traded with you; they exchanged wheat from Minnith, cakes and honey, oil and balm for your merchandise.
Because of your many products and your great wealth of goods, Damascus traded with you wine from Helbon, wool from Zahar,
and casks of wine from Izal for your wares.
Dedan was your merchant in saddlecloths for riding.
Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your customers, trading in lambs, rams, and goats.
The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you; for your wares they exchanged gold, the finest of all spices, and precious stones.
Haran, Canneh, and Eden traded with you, and so did the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad.
In your marketplace they traded with you fine garments of blue, embroidered work, and multicolored rugs with cords tightly twisted and knotted.
The ships of Tarshish
Your oarsmen have brought you
Your wealth, wares, and merchandise,
The countryside will shake
All who handle the oars
They will raise their voices for you
They will shave their heads for you
As they wail and mourn over you,
When your wares went out to sea,
Now you are shattered by the seas
All the people of the coastlands
Those who trade among the nations
