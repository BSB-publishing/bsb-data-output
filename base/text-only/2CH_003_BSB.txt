Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared
Solomon began construction on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
The foundation that Solomon laid for the house of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide,
The portico at the front, extending across the width of the temple, was twenty cubits long
He paneled the main room with cypress,
He adorned the temple with precious stones for beauty, and its gold was from Parvaim.
He overlaid its beams, thresholds, walls, and doors with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls.
Then he made the Most Holy Place;
The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold.
In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim of sculptured work, and he overlaid them with gold.
The total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long
The wing of the second cherub also measured five cubits and touched the wall of the temple, while its other wing measured five cubits and touched the wing of the first cherub.
So the total wingspan of these cherubim was twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing the main room.
He made the veil of blue, purple, and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim woven into it.
In front of the temple he made two pillars, which together were thirty-five cubits high,
He made interwoven chains
Then he set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south and one on the north. The pillar on the south he named Jachin,
