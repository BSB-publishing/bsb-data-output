“I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me;
All day long I have held out My hands
to a people who continually provoke Me to My face,
sitting among the graves,
They say, ‘Keep to yourself;
Behold, it is written before Me:
both for your iniquities
This is what the LORD says:
And I will bring forth descendants from Jacob,
Sharon will become a pasture for flocks,
But you who forsake the LORD,
I will destine you for the sword,
Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
My servants will shout for joy with a glad heart,
You will leave behind your name
Whoever invokes a blessing in the land
For behold, I will create
But be glad and rejoice forever
I will rejoice in Jerusalem
No longer will a nursing infant live but a few days,
They will build houses and dwell in them;
No longer will they build houses for others to inhabit,
They will not labor in vain
Even before they call, I will answer,
The wolf and the lamb will feed together,
