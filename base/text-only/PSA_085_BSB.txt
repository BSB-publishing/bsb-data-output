For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
You forgave the iniquity of Your people;
You withheld all Your fury;
Restore us, O God of our salvation,
Will You be angry with us forever?
Will You not revive us again,
Show us Your loving devotion, O LORD,
I will listen to what God the LORD will say;
Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him,
Loving devotion and faithfulness have joined together;
Faithfulness sprouts from the earth,
The LORD will indeed provide what is good,
Righteousness will go before Him
