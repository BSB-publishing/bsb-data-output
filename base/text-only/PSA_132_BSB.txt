A song of ascents.
how he swore an oath to the LORD,
“I will not enter my house
I will not give sleep to my eyes
until I find a place for the LORD,
We heard that the ark was in Ephrathah;
Let us go to His dwelling place;
Arise, O LORD, to Your resting place,
May Your priests be clothed with righteousness,
For the sake of Your servant David,
The LORD swore an oath to David,
If your sons keep My covenant
For the LORD has chosen Zion;
“This is My resting place forever and ever;
I will bless her with abundant provisions;
I will clothe her priests with salvation,
There I will make a horn grow for David;
I will clothe his enemies with shame,
