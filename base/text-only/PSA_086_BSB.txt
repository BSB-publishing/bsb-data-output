A prayer of David.
Preserve my soul, for I am godly.
Be merciful to me, O Lord,
Bring joy to Your servant,
For You, O Lord, are kind and forgiving,
Hear my prayer, O LORD,
In the day of my distress I call on You,
O Lord, there is none like You among the gods,
All the nations You have made
For You are great and perform wonders;
Teach me Your way, O LORD,
I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart;
For great is Your loving devotion to me;
The arrogant rise against me, O God;
But You, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God,
Turn to me and have mercy;
Show me a sign of Your goodness,
