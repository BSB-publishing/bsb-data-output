I will stand at my guard post
Then the LORD answered me:
For the vision awaits an appointed time;
Look at the proud one; his soul is not upright
and wealth
Will not all of these take up a taunt against him,
Will not your creditors suddenly arise
Because you have plundered many nations,
Woe to him who builds his house
You have plotted shame for your house
For the stones will cry out from the wall,
Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed
Is it not indeed from the LORD of Hosts
For the earth will be filled
Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbors,
You will be filled with shame instead of glory.
For your violence against Lebanon will overwhelm you,
What use is an idol,
Woe to him who says to wood, ‘Awake!’
But the LORD is in His holy temple;
