For the choirmaster, to be accompanied by flutes. A Psalm of David.
Attend to the sound of my cry,
In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice;
For You are not a God who delights in wickedness;
The boastful cannot stand in Your presence;
You destroy those who tell lies;
But I will enter Your house
Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness
For not a word they speak can be trusted;
Declare them guilty, O God;
But let all who take refuge in You rejoice;
For surely You, O LORD, bless the righteous;
