These are the proverbs of Solomon son of David,
for gaining wisdom and discipline,
and for receiving instruction in wise living
To impart prudence to the simple
let the wise listen and gain instruction,
by understanding the proverbs and parables,
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge,
Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction,
For they are a garland of grace on your head
My son, if sinners entice you,
If they say, “Come along, let us lie in wait for blood,
let us swallow them alive like Sheol,
We will find all manner of precious goods;
Throw in your lot with us;
my son, do not walk the road with them
For their feet run to evil,
How futile it is to spread the net
But they lie in wait for their own blood;
Such is the fate of all who are greedy,
Wisdom calls out in the street,
in the main concourse
“How long, O simple ones, will you love your simple ways?
If you had repented at my rebuke,
Because you refused my call,
because you neglected all my counsel,
in turn I will mock your calamity;
when your dread comes like a storm,
Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;
For they hated knowledge
They accepted none of my counsel;
So they will eat the fruit of their own way,
For the waywardness of the simple will slay them,
But whoever listens to me will dwell in safety,
