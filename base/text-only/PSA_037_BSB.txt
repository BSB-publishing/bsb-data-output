Of David.
For they wither quickly like grass
Trust in the LORD and do good;
Delight yourself in the LORD,
Commit your way to the LORD;
He will bring forth your righteousness like the dawn,
Be still before the LORD
Refrain from anger and abandon wrath;
For the evildoers will be cut off,
Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more;
But the meek will inherit the land
The wicked scheme against the righteous
but the Lord laughs,
The wicked have drawn the sword
But their swords will pierce their own hearts,
Better is the little of the righteous
For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
The LORD knows the days of the blameless,
In the time of evil they will not be ashamed,
But the wicked and enemies of the LORD
The wicked borrow and do not repay,
Surely those He blesses will inherit the land,
The steps of a man are ordered by the LORD
Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed,
I once was young and now am old,
They are ever generous and quick to lend,
Turn away from evil and do good,
For the LORD loves justice
The righteous will inherit the land
The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom,
The law of his God is in his heart;
Though the wicked lie in wait for the righteous,
the LORD will not leave them in their power
Wait for the LORD and keep His way,
I have seen a wicked, ruthless man
yet he passed away and was no more;
Consider the blameless and observe the upright,
But the transgressors will all be destroyed;
The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD;
The LORD helps and delivers them;
