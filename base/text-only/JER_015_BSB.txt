Then the LORD said to me: “Even if Moses and Samuel should stand before Me, My heart would not go out to this people. Send them from My presence, and let them go!
If they ask you, ‘Where shall we go?’ you are to tell them that this is what the LORD says:
I will appoint over them four kinds of destroyers, declares the LORD: the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, and the birds of the air and beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did in Jerusalem.
Who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem?
You have forsaken Me, declares the LORD.
I will scatter them with a winnowing fork
I will make their widows more numerous
The mother of seven will grow faint;
Woe to me, my mother,
The LORD said:
Can anyone smash iron —
Your wealth and your treasures
Then I will enslave you to your enemies
You understand, O LORD;
Your words were found, and I ate them.
I never sat with the band of revelers,
Why is my pain unending,
Therefore this is what the LORD says:
Then I will make you a wall to this people,
I will deliver you from the hand of the wicked
