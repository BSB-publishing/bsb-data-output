Where has your beloved gone,
My beloved has gone down to his garden,
I belong to my beloved and he belongs to me;
You are as beautiful, my darling, as Tirzah,
Turn your eyes away from me,
Your teeth are like a flock of sheep
Your brow behind your veil
There are sixty queens and eighty concubines,
but my dove, my perfect one, is unique,
Who is this who shines like the dawn,
I went down to the walnut grove
Before I realized it, my desire had set me
Come back, come back, O Shulammite!
