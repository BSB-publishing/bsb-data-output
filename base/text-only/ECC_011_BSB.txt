Cast your bread upon the waters,
Divide your portion among seven, or even eight,
If the clouds are full,
He who watches the wind will fail to sow,
As you do not know the path of the wind,
Sow your seed in the morning,
Light is sweet,
So if a man lives many years,
Rejoice, O young man, while you are young,
So banish sorrow from your heart,
