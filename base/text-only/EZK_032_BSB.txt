In the twelfth year, on the first day of the twelfth month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Son of man, take up a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him:
This is what the Lord GOD says:
I will abandon you on the land
I will put your flesh on the mountains
I will drench the land
When I extinguish you,
All the shining lights in the heavens
‘I will trouble the hearts of many peoples,
I will cause many peoples
For this is what the Lord GOD says:
I will make your hordes fall
I will slaughter all her cattle
Then I will let her waters settle
‘When I make the land of Egypt a desolation
This is the lament they will chant for her; the daughters of the nations will chant it. Over Egypt and all her multitudes they will chant it, declares the Lord GOD.”
In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month,
“Son of man, wail for the multitudes of Egypt, and consign her and the daughters of the mighty nations to the depths of the earth with those who descend to the Pit:
Whom do you surpass in beauty?
They will fall among those slain by the sword.
Mighty chiefs will speak from the midst of Sheol
Assyria is there with her whole company;
Her graves are set in the depths of the Pit,
Elam is there
Among the slain they prepare
Meshech and Tubal are there
They do not lie down
But you too will be shattered
Edom is there,
All the leaders of the north
Pharaoh will see them
For I will spread My terror
