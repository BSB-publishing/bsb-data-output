“Listen to Me, you who pursue righteousness,
Look to Abraham your father,
For the LORD will comfort Zion
Pay attention to Me, My people,
My righteousness draws near,
Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
Listen to Me, you who know what is right,
For the moth will devour them like a garment,
Awake, awake,
Was it not You who dried up the sea,
So the redeemed of the LORD will return
“I, even I, am He who comforts you.
But you have forgotten the LORD, your Maker,
The captive will soon be freed;
For I am the LORD your God
I have put My words in your mouth,
Awake, awake!
Among all the sons she bore,
These pairs have befallen you:
Your sons have fainted;
Therefore now hear this, you afflicted one,
Thus says your Lord, the LORD,
I will place it in the hands of your tormentors,
