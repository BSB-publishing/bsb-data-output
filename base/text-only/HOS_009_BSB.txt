Do not rejoice, O Israel,
The threshing floor and winepress will not feed them,
They will not remain
They will not pour out wine offerings to the LORD,
What will you do on the appointed day,
For even if they flee destruction,
The days of punishment have come;
The prophet is Ephraim’s watchman,
They have deeply corrupted themselves
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.
Ephraim’s glory will fly away like a bird,
Even if they raise their children,
I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre,
Give them, O LORD—
All their evil appears at Gilgal,
Ephraim is struck down;
My God will reject them
