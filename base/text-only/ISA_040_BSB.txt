“Comfort, comfort My people,”
“Speak tenderly to Jerusalem,
A voice of one calling:
Every valley shall be lifted up,
And the glory of the LORD will be revealed,
A voice says, “Cry out!”
The grass withers and the flowers fall
The grass withers and the flowers fall,
Go up on a high mountain,
Behold, the Lord GOD comes with might,
He tends His flock like a shepherd;
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD,
Whom did He consult to enlighten Him,
Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket;
Lebanon is not sufficient for fuel,
All the nations are as nothing before Him;
To whom will you liken God?
To an idol that a craftsman casts
One lacking such an offering
Do you not know?
He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth;
He brings the princes to nothing
No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown,
“To whom will you liken Me,
Lift up your eyes on high:
Why do you say, O Jacob,
Do you not know?
He gives power to the faint
Even youths grow tired and weary,
But those who wait upon the LORD will renew their strength;
