Rejoice in the LORD, O righteous ones;
Praise the LORD with the harp;
Sing to Him a new song;
For the word of the LORD is upright,
The LORD loves righteousness and justice;
By the word of the LORD the heavens were made,
He piles up the waters of the sea;
Let all the earth fear the LORD;
For He spoke, and it came to be;
The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations;
The counsel of the LORD stands forever,
Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD,
The LORD looks down from heaven;
From His dwelling place He gazes
He shapes the hearts of each;
No king is saved by his vast army;
A horse is a vain hope for salvation;
Surely the eyes of the LORD are on those who fear Him,
to deliver them from death
Our soul waits for the LORD;
For our hearts rejoice in Him,
May Your loving devotion rest on us, O LORD,
