Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread,
and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to put Jesus to death, for they feared the people.
Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve.
And Judas went to discuss with the chief priests and temple officers how he might betray Jesus to them.
They were delighted and agreed to give him money.
Judas consented, and began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them in the absence of a crowd.
Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed.
Jesus sent Peter and John, saying,
“Where do You want us to prepare it?” they asked.
He answered,
and say to the owner of that house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’
And he will show you a large upper room, already furnished. Make preparations there.”
So they went and found it just as Jesus had told them. And they prepared the Passover.
When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at the table with His apostles.
And He said to them,
For I tell you that I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”
After taking the cup, He gave thanks and said,
For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.”
And He took the bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying,
In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying,
Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.”
Then they began to question among themselves which of them was going to do this.
A dispute also arose among the disciples as to which of them should be considered the greatest.
So Jesus declared,
But you shall not be like them. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.
For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves.
And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as My Father has bestowed one on Me,
so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
But I have prayed for you,  Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”
“Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death.”
But Jesus replied,
Then Jesus asked them,
“Now, however,”
For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors.’
So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.”
Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him.
When He came to the place, He told them,
And He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed,
“Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.”
Then an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him.
And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.
When Jesus rose from prayer and returned to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.
“Why are you sleeping?”
While He was still speaking, a crowd arrived, led by the man called Judas, one of the Twelve. He approached Jesus to kiss Him.
But Jesus asked him,
Those around Jesus saw what was about to happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
But Jesus answered,
Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple officers, and elders who had come for Him,
Every day I was with you in the temple courts,
Then they seized Jesus, led Him away, and took Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed at a distance.
When those present had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.
A servant girl saw him seated in the firelight and looked intently at him. “This man also was with Him,” she said.
But Peter denied it. “Woman, I do not know Him,” he said.
A short time later, someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.”
About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.”
“Man, I do not know what you are talking about,” Peter replied.
And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.
And he went outside and wept bitterly.
The men who were holding Jesus began to mock Him and beat Him.
They blindfolded Him
And they said many other blasphemous things against Him.
At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and scribes, met together. They led Jesus into their Sanhedrin
“If You are the Christ, tell us.”
And if I ask you a question, you will not answer.
But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”
So they all asked, “Are You then the Son of God?”
“Why do we need any more testimony?” they declared. “We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips.”
