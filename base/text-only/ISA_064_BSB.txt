If only You would rend the heavens and come down,
as fire kindles the brushwood
When You did awesome works that we did not expect,
From ancient times no one has heard,
You welcome those who gladly do right,
Each of us has become like something unclean,
No one calls on Your name
But now, O LORD, You are our Father;
Do not be angry, O LORD, beyond measure;
Your holy cities have become a wilderness.
Our holy and beautiful temple,
After all this, O LORD,
