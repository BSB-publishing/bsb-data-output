Every wise woman builds her house,
He who walks in uprightness fears the LORD,
The proud speech of a fool brings a rod to his back,
Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty,
An honest witness does not deceive,
A mocker seeks wisdom and finds none,
Stay away from a foolish man;
The wisdom of the prudent is to discern his way,
Fools mock the making of amends,
The heart knows its own bitterness,
The house of the wicked will be destroyed,
There is a way that seems right to a man,
Even in laughter the heart may ache,
The backslider in heart receives the fill of his own ways,
The simple man believes every word,
A wise man fears
A quick-tempered man acts foolishly,
The simple inherit folly,
The evil bow before the good,
The poor man is hated even by his neighbor,
He who despises his neighbor sins,
Do not those who contrive evil go astray?
There is profit in all labor,
The crown of the wise is their wealth,
A truthful witness saves lives,
He who fears the LORD is secure in confidence,
The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life,
A large population is a king’s splendor,
A patient man has great understanding,
A tranquil heart is life to the body,
Whoever oppresses the poor taunts their Maker,
The wicked man is thrown down by his own sin,
Wisdom rests in the heart of the discerning;
Righteousness exalts a nation,
A king delights in a wise servant,
