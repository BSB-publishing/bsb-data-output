For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob; once again He will choose Israel and settle them in their own land. The foreigner will join them and unite with the house of Jacob.
The nations will escort Israel and bring it to its homeland.
On the day that the LORD gives you rest from your pain and torment, and from the hard labor into which you were forced,
you will sing this song of contempt against the king of Babylon:
The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked,
It struck the peoples in anger
All the earth is at peace and at rest;
Even the cypresses
Sheol beneath is eager
They will all respond to you, saying,
Your pomp has been brought down to Sheol,
How you have fallen from heaven,
You said in your heart:
I will ascend above the tops of the clouds;
But you will be brought down to Sheol,
Those who see you will stare;
who turned the world into a desert
All the kings of the nations lie in state,
But you are cast out of your grave like a rejected branch,
You will not join them in burial,
Prepare a place to slaughter his sons
“I will rise up against them,”
“I will make her a place
The LORD of Hosts has sworn:
I will break Assyria in My land;
This is the plan devised for the whole earth,
The LORD of Hosts has purposed,
In the year that King Ahaz died, this burden was received:
Do not rejoice, all you Philistines,
Then the firstborn of the poor will find pasture,
Wail, O gate! Cry out, O city!
What answer will be given
