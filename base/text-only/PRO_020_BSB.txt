Wine is a mocker, strong drink is a brawler,
The terror of a king is like the roar of a lion;
It is honorable for a man to resolve a dispute,
The slacker does not plow in season;
The intentions of a man’s heart are deep waters,
Many a man proclaims his loving devotion,
The righteous man walks with integrity;
A king who sits on a throne to judge
Who can say, “I have kept my heart pure;
Differing weights and unequal measures
Even a young man is known by his actions—
Ears that hear and eyes that see—
Do not love sleep, or you will grow poor;
“Worthless, worthless!” says the buyer,
There is an abundance of gold and rubies,
Take the garment of the one who posts security for a stranger;
Food gained by fraud is sweet to a man,
Set plans by consultation,
He who reveals secrets is a constant gossip;
Whoever curses his father or mother,
An inheritance gained quickly
Do not say, “I will avenge this evil!”
Unequal weights are detestable to the LORD,
A man’s steps are from the LORD,
It is a trap for a man to dedicate something rashly,
A wise king separates out the wicked
The spirit
Loving devotion and faithfulness preserve a king;
The glory of young men is their strength,
Lashes and wounds scour evil,
