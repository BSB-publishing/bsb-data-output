Come, let us return to the LORD.
After two days He will revive us;
So let us know —
What shall I do with you, O Ephraim
Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets;
For I desire mercy, not sacrifice,
But they, like Adam, have transgressed
Gilead is a city of evildoers,
Like raiders who lie in ambush,
In the house of Israel
Also for you, O Judah,
