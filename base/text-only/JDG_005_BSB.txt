On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:
“When the princes take the lead in Israel,
Listen, O kings! Give ear, O princes!
O LORD, when You went out from Seir,
The mountains quaked before the LORD,
In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,
Life in the villages ceased;
When they chose new gods,
My heart is with the princes of Israel,
You who ride white donkeys,
the voices of the singers
‘Awake, awake, O Deborah!
Then the survivors came down to the nobles;
Some came from Ephraim, with their roots in Amalek;
The princes of Issachar were with Deborah,
Why did you sit among the sheepfolds
Gilead remained beyond the Jordan.
Zebulun was a people who risked their lives;
Kings came and fought;
From the heavens the stars fought;
The River Kishon swept them away,
Then the hooves of horses thundered—
‘Curse Meroz,’ says the angel of the LORD.
Most blessed among women is Jael,
He asked for water, and she gave him milk.
She reached for the tent peg,
At her feet he collapsed, he fell,
Sisera’s mother looked through the window;
Her wisest ladies answer;
‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoil—
So may all Your enemies perish,
