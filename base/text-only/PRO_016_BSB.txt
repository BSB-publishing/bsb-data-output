The plans of the heart belong to man,
All a man’s ways are pure in his own eyes,
Commit your works to the LORD
The LORD has made everything for His purpose—
Everyone who is proud in heart is detestable to the LORD;
By loving devotion and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for,
When a man’s ways please the LORD,
Better a little with righteousness
A man’s heart plans his course,
A divine verdict is on the lips of a king;
Honest scales and balances are from the LORD;
Wicked behavior is detestable for kings,
Righteous lips are a king’s delight,
The wrath of a king is a messenger of death,
When a king’s face brightens, there is life;
How much better to acquire wisdom than gold!
The highway of the upright leads away from evil;
Pride goes before destruction,
It is better to be lowly in spirit among the humble
Whoever heeds instruction will find success,
The wise in heart are called discerning,
Understanding is a fountain of life to its possessor,
The heart of the wise man instructs his mouth
Pleasant words are a honeycomb,
There is a way that seems right to a man,
A worker’s appetite works for him
A worthless man digs up evil,
A perverse man spreads dissension,
A violent man entices his neighbor
He who winks his eye devises perversity;
Gray hair is a crown of glory;
He who is slow to anger is better than a warrior,
The lot is cast into the lap,
