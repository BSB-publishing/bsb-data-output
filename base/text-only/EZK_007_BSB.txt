And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“O son of man, this is what the Lord GOD says to the land of Israel:
The end is now upon you,
I will not look on you with pity,
This is what the Lord GOD says:
The end has come!
Doom has come to you,
Very soon I will pour out My wrath upon you
I will not look on you with pity,
Behold, the day is here!
Their violence has grown into a rod
The time has come;
The seller will surely not recover what he sold
They have blown the trumpet
The sword is outside;
The survivors will escape
Every hand will go limp,
They will put on sackcloth,
They will throw their silver into the streets,
His beautiful ornaments
And I will hand these things over
I will turn My face away from them,
Forge the chain,
So I will bring the most wicked of nations
Anguish is coming!
Disaster upon disaster will come,
The king will mourn,
