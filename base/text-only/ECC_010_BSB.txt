As dead flies bring a stench to the perfumer’s oil,
A wise man’s heart inclines to the right,
Even as the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking,
If the ruler’s temper flares against you, do not abandon your post,
There is an evil I have seen under the sun —
Folly is appointed to great heights,
I have seen slaves on horseback,
He who digs a pit may fall into it,
The one who quarries stones may be injured by them,
If the axe is dull and the blade unsharpened,
If the snake bites before it is charmed,
The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious,
The beginning of his talk is folly,
Yet the fool multiplies words.
The toil of a fool wearies him,
Woe to you, O land whose king is a youth,
Blessed are you, O land whose king is a son of nobles,
Through laziness the roof caves in,
A feast is prepared for laughter, and wine makes life merry,
Do not curse the king even in your thoughts,
