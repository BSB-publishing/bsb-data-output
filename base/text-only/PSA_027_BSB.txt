Of David.
When the wicked came upon me to devour my flesh,
Though an army encamps around me,
One thing I have asked of the LORD;
For in the day of trouble
Then my head will be held high
Hear, O LORD, my voice when I call;
My heart said, “Seek His face.”
Hide not Your face from me,
Though my father and mother forsake me,
Teach me Your way, O LORD,
Do not hand me over to the will of my foes,
Still I am certain to see
Wait patiently for the LORD;
