“I have made a covenant with my eyes.
For what is the allotment of God from above,
Does not disaster come to the unjust
Does He not see my ways
If I have walked in falsehood
let God weigh me with honest scales,
If my steps have turned from the path,
then may another eat what I have sown,
If my heart has been enticed by my neighbor’s wife,
then may my own wife grind grain for another,
For that would be a heinous crime,
For it is a fire that burns down to Abaddon;
If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or maidservant
what will I do when God rises to judge?
Did not He who made me in the womb also make them?
If I have denied the desires of the poor
if I have eaten my morsel alone,
though from my youth I reared him as would a father,
if I have seen one perish for lack of clothing,
if his heart has not blessed me
if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless
then may my arm fall from my shoulder
For calamity from God terrifies me,
If I have put my trust in gold
if I have rejoiced in my great wealth
if I have beheld the sun
so that my heart was secretly enticed
this would also be an iniquity to be judged,
If I have rejoiced in my enemy’s ruin,
I have not allowed my mouth to sin
if the men of my house have not said,
but no stranger had to lodge on the street,
if I have covered my transgressions like Adam
because I greatly feared the crowds
(Oh, that I had one to hear me!
Surely I would carry it on my shoulder
I would give account of all my steps;
if my land cries out against me
if I have devoured its produce without payment
then let briers grow instead of wheat
