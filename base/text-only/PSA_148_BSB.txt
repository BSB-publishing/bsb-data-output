Hallelujah!
Praise Him, all His angels;
Praise Him, O sun and moon;
Praise Him, O highest heavens,
Let them praise the name of the LORD,
He established them forever and ever;
Praise the LORD from the earth,
lightning and hail, snow and clouds,
mountains and all hills,
wild animals and all cattle,
kings of the earth and all peoples,
young men and maidens,
Let them praise the name of the LORD,
He has raised up a horn for His people,
