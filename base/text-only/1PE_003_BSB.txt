For Christ also suffered
in whom
who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built.
And this water symbolizes the baptism that now saves you also — not the removal of dirt from the body, but the pledge of
who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers subject to Him.
