Then the LORD said to me, “Go show love to your wife again, though she is loved by another
So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver
Then I said to her, “You must live with me for many days; you must not be promiscuous or belong to another, and I will do the same for you.”
For the Israelites must live many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar, and without ephod or idol.
Afterward, the people of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days.
