These are the words of Amos, who was among the sheepherders
He said:
This is what the LORD says:
So I will send fire upon the house of Hazael
I will break down the gates of Damascus;
This is what the LORD says:
So I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza,
I will cut off the ruler of Ashdod
This is what the LORD says:
So I will send fire upon the walls of Tyre
This is what the LORD says:
So I will send fire upon Teman
This is what the LORD says:
So I will kindle a fire in the walls of Rabbah
Their king will go into exile
