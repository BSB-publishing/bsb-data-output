This is what the LORD says to Cyrus His anointed,
“I will go before you
I will give you the treasures of darkness
For the sake of Jacob My servant
I am the LORD, and there is no other;
so that all may know,
I form the light and create the darkness;
Drip down, O heavens, from above,
Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker—
Woe to him who says to his father,
Thus says the LORD,
It is I who made the earth
I will raise up Cyrus in righteousness,
This is what the LORD says:
Truly You are a God who hides Himself,
They will all be put to shame and humiliated;
But Israel will be saved by the LORD
For thus says the LORD,
I have not spoken in secret,
Come, gather together, and draw near,
Speak up and present your case—
Turn to Me and be saved,
By Myself I have sworn;
Surely they will say of Me,
In the LORD all descendants of Israel
