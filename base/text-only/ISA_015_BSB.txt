This is the burden against Moab:
Dibon goes up to its temple
In its streets they wear sackcloth;
Heshbon and Elealeh cry out;
My heart cries out over Moab;
The waters of Nimrim are dried up,
So they carry their wealth and belongings
For their outcry echoes to the border of Moab.
The waters of Dimon
