Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
“Does a wise man answer with empty counsel
Should he argue with useless words
But you even undermine the fear of God
For your iniquity instructs your mouth,
Your own mouth, not mine, condemns you;
Were you the first man ever born?
Do you listen in on the council of God
What do you know that we do not?
Both the gray-haired and the aged are on our side —
Are the consolations of God not enough for you,
Why has your heart carried you away,
so that you turn your spirit against God
What is man, that he should be pure,
If God puts no trust in His holy ones,
how much less man, who is vile and corrupt,
Listen to me and I will inform you.
what was declared by wise men
to whom alone the land was given
A wicked man writhes in pain all his days;
Sounds of terror fill his ears;
He despairs of his return from darkness;
He wanders about as food for vultures;
Distress and anguish terrify him,
For he has stretched out his hand against God
rushing headlong at Him
Though his face is covered with fat
he will dwell in ruined cities,
He will no longer be rich; his wealth will not endure.
He will not escape from the darkness;
Let him not deceive himself with trust in emptiness,
It will be paid in full before his time,
He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes,
For the company of the godless will be barren,
They conceive trouble and give birth to evil;
