Hallelujah!
The LORD builds up Jerusalem;
He heals the brokenhearted
He determines the number of the stars;
Great is our Lord, and mighty in power;
The LORD sustains the humble,
Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving;
who covers the sky with clouds,
He provides food for the animals,
He does not delight in the strength of the horse;
The LORD is pleased with those who fear Him,
Exalt the LORD, O Jerusalem;
For He strengthens the bars of your gates
He makes peace at your borders;
He sends forth His command to the earth;
He spreads the snow like wool;
He casts forth His hail like pebbles.
He sends forth His word and melts them;
He declares His word to Jacob,
He has done this for no other nation;
