For behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts
the mighty man and the warrior,
the commander of fifty and the dignitary,
“I will make mere lads their leaders,
The people will oppress one another,
A man will seize his brother
On that day he will cry aloud:
For Jerusalem has stumbled
The expression on their faces testifies against them,
Tell the righteous it will be well with them,
Woe to the wicked; disaster is upon them!
Youths oppress My people,
The LORD arises to contend;
The LORD brings this charge
Why do you crush My people
The LORD also says:
the Lord will bring sores
In that day the Lord will take away their finery:
their pendants, bracelets, and veils;
their headdresses, ankle chains, and sashes;
their signet rings and nose rings;
their festive robes, capes, cloaks, and purses;
and their mirrors, linen garments, tiaras, and shawls.
Instead of fragrance
Your men will fall by the sword,
And the gates of Zion will lament and mourn;
