“Yes, in those days and at that time,
I will gather all the nations
They cast lots for My people;
Now what do you have against Me, O Tyre, Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you rendering against Me a recompense? If you retaliate against Me, I will swiftly and speedily return your recompense upon your heads.
For you took My silver and gold and carried off My finest treasures to your temples.
You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks,
Behold, I will rouse them from the places to which you sold them; I will return your recompense upon your heads.
I will sell your sons and daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans — to a distant nation.”
Proclaim this among the nations:
Beat your plowshares into swords
Come quickly, all you surrounding nations,
Let the nations be roused
Swing the sickle,
Multitudes, multitudes
The sun and moon will grow dark,
The LORD will roar from Zion
Then you will know that I am the LORD your God,
And in that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine,
Egypt will become desolate,
But Judah will be inhabited forever,
For I will avenge their blood,
