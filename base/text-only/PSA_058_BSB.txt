For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam
No, in your hearts you devise injustice;
The wicked are estranged from the womb;
Their venom is like the venom of a snake,
refusing to hear the tune of the charmer
O God, shatter their teeth in their mouths;
May they vanish
Like a slug that dissolves in its slime,
Before your pots can feel the burning thorns—
The righteous will rejoice
Then men will say,
