A Psalm.
The LORD has proclaimed His salvation
He has remembered His love and faithfulness
Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth;
Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre,
With trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn
Let the sea resound, and all that fills it,
Let the rivers clap their hands,
before the LORD,
