Hallelujah!
His descendants will be mighty in the land;
Wealth and riches are in his house,
Light dawns in the darkness for the upright —
It is well with the man who is generous and lends freely,
Surely he will never be shaken;
He does not fear bad news;
His heart is assured; he does not fear,
He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor;
The wicked man will see and be grieved;
