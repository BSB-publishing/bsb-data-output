Come near, O nations, to listen;
The LORD is angry with all the nations
Their slain will be left unburied,
All the stars of heaven will be dissolved.
When My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens,
The sword of the LORD is bathed in blood.
And the wild oxen will fall with them,
For the LORD has a day of vengeance,
Edom’s streams will be turned to tar,
It will not be quenched— day or night.
The desert owl and screech owl will possess it,
No nobles will be left to proclaim a king,
Her towers will be overgrown with thorns,
The desert creatures will meet with hyenas,
There the owl will make her nest;
Search and read the scroll of the LORD:
He has allotted their portion;
