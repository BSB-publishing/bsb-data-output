Why do the nations rage
The kings of the earth take their stand
“Let us break Their chains
The One enthroned in heaven laughs;
Then He rebukes them in His anger,
“I have installed My King on Zion,
I will proclaim the decree
Ask Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance,
You will break them
Therefore be wise, O kings;
Serve the LORD with fear,
Kiss the Son, lest He be angry
