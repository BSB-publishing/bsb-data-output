In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Put your house in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover.’”
Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
saying, “Please, O LORD, remember how I have walked before You faithfully and with wholehearted devotion; I have done what is good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
And the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying,
“Go and tell Hezekiah that this is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: ‘I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.
This will be a sign to you from the LORD that He will do what He has promised:
I will make the sun’s shadow that falls on the stairway of Ahaz go back ten steps.’”
This is a writing by Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:
I said, “In the prime
I said, “I will never again see the LORD,
My dwelling has been picked up and removed from me
I composed myself
I chirp like a swallow or crane;
What can I say?
O Lord, by such things men live,
Surely for my own welfare
For Sheol cannot thank You;
The living, only the living, can thank You,
The LORD will save me;
Now Isaiah had said, “Prepare a lump of pressed figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.”
And Hezekiah had asked, “What will be the sign that I will go up to the house of the LORD?”
