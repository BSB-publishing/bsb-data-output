When Israel was a child, I loved him,
But the more I called Israel,
It was I who taught Ephraim
I led them with cords of kindness,
Will they not return to the land of Egypt
A sword will flash through their cities;
My people are bent on turning from Me.
How could I give you up, O Ephraim?
I will not execute the full fury of My anger;
They will walk after the LORD;
They will come trembling like birds from Egypt
Ephraim surrounds Me with lies,
