A prayer of David.
May my vindication come from Your presence;
You have tried my heart;
As for the deeds of men —
My steps have held to Your paths;
I call on You, O God,
Show the wonders of Your loving devotion,
Keep me as the apple of
from the wicked who assail me,
They have closed their callous hearts;
They have tracked us down, and now surround us;
like a lion greedy for prey,
Arise, O LORD, confront them!
from such men, O LORD, by Your hand—
As for me, I will behold Your face in righteousness;
