For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lily of the Covenant.” A Miktam
You have shaken the land
You have shown Your people hardship;
You have raised a banner for those who fear You,
Respond and save us with Your right hand,
God has spoken from His sanctuary:
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine;
Moab is My washbasin;
Who will bring me to the fortified city?
Have You not rejected us, O God?
Give us aid against the enemy,
With God we will perform with valor,
