Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
“How long will you go on saying such things?
Does God pervert justice?
When your children sinned against Him,
But if you would earnestly seek God
if you are pure and upright,
Though your beginnings were modest,
Please inquire of past generations
For we were born yesterday and know nothing;
Will they not teach you and tell you,
Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh?
While the shoots are still uncut,
Such is the destiny of all who forget God;
His confidence is fragile;
He leans on his web, but it gives way;
He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine,
His roots wrap around the rock heap;
If he is uprooted from his place,
Surely this is the joy of his way;
Behold, God does not reject the blameless,
He will yet fill your mouth with laughter,
Your enemies will be clothed in shame,
