“Say of your brothers, ‘My people,’
Rebuke your mother,
Otherwise, I will strip her naked
I will have no compassion on her children,
For their mother has played the harlot
Therefore, behold,
She will pursue her lovers but not catch them;
For she does not acknowledge
Therefore I will take back My grain in its time
And then I will expose her lewdness
I will put an end to all her exultation:
I will destroy her vines and fig trees,
I will punish her for the days of the Baals
“Therefore, behold, I will allure her
There I will give back her vineyards
In that day,”
For I will remove from her lips the names of the Baals;
On that day I will make a covenant for them
So I will betroth you to Me forever;
And I will betroth you in faithfulness,
“On that day I will respond —”
And the earth will respond to the grain,
And I will sow her as My own in the land,
