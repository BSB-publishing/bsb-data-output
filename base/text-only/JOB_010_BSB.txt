“I loathe my own life;
I will say to God:
Does it please You to oppress me,
Do You have eyes of flesh?
Are Your days like those of a mortal,
that You should seek my iniquity
though You know that I am not guilty,
Your hands shaped me and altogether formed me.
Please remember that You molded me like clay.
Did You not pour me out like milk,
You clothed me with skin and flesh,
You have granted me life and loving devotion,
Yet You concealed these things in Your heart,
If I sinned, You would take note,
If I am guilty, woe to me!
Should I hold my head high,
You produce new witnesses against me
Why then did You bring me from the womb?
If only I had never come to be,
Are my days not few?
before I go — never to return —
to a land of utter darkness,
