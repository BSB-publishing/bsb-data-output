This is a prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth:
O LORD, I have heard the report of You;
God came from Teman,
His radiance was like the sunlight;
Plague went before Him,
He stood and measured the earth;
I saw the tents of Cushan in distress;
Were You angry at the rivers, O LORD?
You brandished Your bow;
The mountains saw You and quaked;
Sun and moon stood still
You marched across the earth with fury;
You went forth for the salvation of Your people,
With his own spear You pierced his head,
You trampled the sea with Your horses,
I heard and trembled within;
Though the fig tree does not bud
yet I will exult in the LORD;
GOD the Lord is my strength;
