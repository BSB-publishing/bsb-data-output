Then I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven: seven angels with the seven final plagues, with which the wrath of God is completed.
And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, beside which stood those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name. They were holding harps from God,
and they sang the song of God’s servant Moses and of the Lamb:
Who will not fear You, O Lord,
After this I looked, and the temple — the tabernacle of the Testimony — was opened in heaven.
And out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, dressed in clean and bright linen and girded with golden sashes around their chests.
Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
