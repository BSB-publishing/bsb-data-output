A song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
Beautiful in loftiness,
God is in her citadels;
For behold, the kings assembled;
They saw and were astounded;
Trembling seized them there,
With a wind from the east
As we have heard, so we have seen
Within Your temple, O God,
Your name, O God, like Your praise,
Mount Zion is glad,
March around Zion, encircle her,
consider her ramparts, tour her citadels,
For this God is our God forever and ever;
