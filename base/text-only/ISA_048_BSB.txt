“Listen to this, O house of Jacob,
who indeed call yourselves after the holy city
I foretold the former things long ago;
For I knew that you are stubborn;
Therefore I declared it to you long ago;
You have heard these things; look at them all.
They are created now, and not long ago;
You have never heard; you have never understood;
For the sake of My name I will delay My wrath;
See, I have refined you, but not as silver;
For My own sake, My very own sake, I will act;
Listen to Me, O Jacob,
Surely My own hand founded the earth,
Come together, all of you, and listen:
I, even I, have spoken;
Come near to Me and listen to this:
Thus says the LORD your Redeemer,
If only you had paid attention to My commandments,
Your descendants would have been as countless as the sand,
Leave Babylon!
They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts;
“There is no peace,” says the LORD,
