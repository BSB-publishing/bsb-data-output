Hear this word,
The Lord GOD has sworn by His holiness:
You will go out through broken walls,
“Go to Bethel and transgress;
Offer leavened bread as a thank offering,
“I afflicted all your cities with cleanness of teeth
“I also withheld the rain from you
People staggered from city to city
“I struck you with blight and mildew
“I sent plagues among you
“Some of you I overthrew
“Therefore, that is what I will do
For behold, He who forms the mountains,
