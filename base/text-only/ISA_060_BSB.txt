Arise, shine, for your light has come,
For behold, darkness covers the earth,
Nations will come to your light,
Lift up your eyes and look around:
Then you will look and be radiant,
Caravans of camels will cover your land,
All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered to you;
Who are these who fly like clouds,
Surely the islands
Foreigners will rebuild your walls,
Your gates will always stand open;
For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish;
The glory of Lebanon will come to you—
The sons of your oppressors
Whereas you have been forsaken and despised,
You will drink the milk of nations
Instead of bronze I will bring you gold;
No longer will violence be heard in your land,
No longer will the sun be your light by day,
Your sun will no longer set,
Then all your people will be righteous;
The least of you will become a thousand,
