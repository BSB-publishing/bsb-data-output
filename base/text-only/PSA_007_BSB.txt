A Shiggaion
or they will shred my soul like a lion
O LORD my God, if I have done this,
if I have rewarded my ally
then may my enemy pursue me and overtake me;
Arise, O LORD, in Your anger;
Let the assembled peoples gather around You;
The LORD judges the peoples;
Put an end to the evil of the wicked,
My shield is with God,
God is a righteous judge
If one does not repent,
He has prepared His deadly weapons;
Behold, the wicked man travails with evil;
He has dug a hole and hollowed it out;
His trouble recoils on himself,
I will thank the LORD for His righteousness
