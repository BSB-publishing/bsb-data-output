Sing to the LORD a new song;
Sing to the LORD, bless His name;
Declare His glory among the nations,
For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised;
For all the gods of the nations are idols,
Splendor and majesty are before Him;
Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations,
Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name;
Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness;
Declare among the nations: “The LORD reigns!”
Let the heavens be glad
Let the fields exult,
before the LORD,
