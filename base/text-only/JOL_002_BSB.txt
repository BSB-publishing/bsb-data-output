Blow the ram’s horn in Zion;
a day of darkness and gloom,
Before them a fire devours,
Their appearance is like that of horses,
With a sound like that of chariots
Nations writhe in horror before them;
They charge like mighty men;
They do not jostle one another;
They storm the city;
Before them the earth quakes;
The LORD raises His voice
“Yet even now,”
So rend your hearts and not your garments,
Who knows? He may turn and relent
Blow the ram’s horn in Zion,
Gather the people, sanctify the congregation,
Let the priests who minister before the LORD
Then the LORD became jealous for His land,
And the LORD answered His people:
The northern army I will drive away from you,
Do not be afraid, O land;
Do not be afraid, O beasts of the field,
Be glad, O children of Zion,
The threshing floors will be full of grain,
I will repay you for the years eaten by locusts —
You will have plenty to eat,
Then you will know that I am present in Israel
And afterward, I will pour out My Spirit on all people.
Even on My menservants and maidservants,
I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth,
The sun will be turned to darkness
And everyone who calls on the name of the LORD
