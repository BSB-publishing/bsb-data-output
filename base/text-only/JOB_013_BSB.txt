“Indeed, my eyes have seen all this;
What you know, I also know;
Yet I desire to speak to the Almighty
You, however, smear with lies;
If only you would remain silent;
Hear now my argument,
Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf
Would you show Him partiality
Would it be well when He examined you?
Surely He would rebuke you
Would His majesty not terrify you?
Your maxims are proverbs of ashes;
Be silent, and I will speak.
Why do I put myself at risk
Though He slay me, I will hope in Him.
Moreover, this will be my salvation,
Listen carefully to my words;
See now, I have prepared my case;
Can anyone indict me?
Only grant these two things to me,
Withdraw Your hand from me,
Then call me, and I will answer,
How many are my iniquities and sins?
Why do You hide Your face
Would You frighten a windblown leaf?
For You record bitter accusations against me
You put my feet in the stocks
So man wastes away like something rotten,
