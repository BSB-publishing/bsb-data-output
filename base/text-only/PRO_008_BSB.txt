Does not wisdom call out,
On the heights overlooking the road,
Beside the gates to the city,
“To you, O men, I call out,
O simple ones, learn to be shrewd;
Listen, for I speak of noble things,
For my mouth will speak the truth,
All the words of my mouth are righteous;
They are all plain to the discerning,
Receive my instruction instead of silver,
For wisdom is more precious than rubies,
I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence,
To fear the LORD is to hate evil;
Counsel and sound judgment are mine;
By me kings reign,
By me princes rule,
I love those who love me,
With me are riches and honor,
My fruit is better than gold, pure gold,
I walk in the way of righteousness,
bestowing wealth on those who love me
The LORD created me as His first course,
From everlasting I was established,
When there were no watery depths, I was brought forth,
Before the mountains were settled,
before He made the land or fields,
I was there when He established the heavens,
when He established the clouds above,
when He set a boundary for the sea,
Then I was a skilled craftsman at His side,
I was rejoicing in His whole world,
Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,
Listen to instruction and be wise;
Blessed is the man who listens to me,
For whoever finds me finds life
But he who fails to find me harms himself;
