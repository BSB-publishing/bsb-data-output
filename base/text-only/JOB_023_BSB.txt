Then Job answered:
“Even today my complaint is bitter.
If only I knew where to find Him,
I would plead my case before Him
I would learn how He would answer,
Would He contend with me in His great power?
Then an upright man could reason with Him,
If I go east, He is not there,
When He is at work in the north, I cannot behold Him;
Yet He knows the way I have taken;
My feet have followed in His tracks;
I have not departed from the command of His lips;
But He is unchangeable, and who can oppose Him?
For He carries out His decree against me,
Therefore I am terrified in His presence;
God has made my heart faint;
Yet I am not silenced by the darkness,
