For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD.
For his eyes are too full of conceit
The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful;
Even on his bed he plots wickedness;
Your loving devotion, O LORD, reaches to the heavens,
Your righteousness is like the highest mountains;
How precious is Your loving devotion, O God,
They feast on the abundance of Your house,
For with You is the fountain of life;
Extend Your loving devotion to those who know You,
Let not the foot of the proud come against me,
There the evildoers lie fallen,
