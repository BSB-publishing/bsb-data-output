Listen to Me, O islands;
He made My mouth like a sharp sword;
He said to Me, “You are My Servant, Israel,
But I said, “I have labored in vain,
And now says the LORD,
He says: “It is not enough for You to be My Servant,
Thus says the LORD,
This is what the LORD says:
to say to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’
They will not hunger or thirst,
I will turn all My mountains into roads,
Behold, they will come from far away,
Shout for joy, O heavens; rejoice, O earth;
But Zion said, “The LORD has forsaken me;
“Can a woman forget her nursing child,
Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands;
Your builders
Lift up your eyes and look around.
For your ruined and desolate places
Yet the children of your bereavement
Then you will say in your heart,
This is what the Lord GOD says:
Kings will be your foster fathers,
Can the plunder be snatched from the mighty,
Indeed, this is what the LORD says:
I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh;
