A Miktam
I said to the LORD, “You are my Lord;
As for the saints in the land,
Sorrows will multiply
The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup;
The lines of my boundary have fallen in pleasant places;
I will bless the LORD who counsels me;
I have set
Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;
For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol,
You have made known to me the path of life;
