A song of ascents. Of David.
Our feet are standing in your gates,
Jerusalem is built up
where the tribes go up,
For there the thrones of judgment stand,
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
May there be peace within your walls,
For the sake of my brothers and friends,
For the sake of the house of the LORD our God,
