A Psalm of David.
Do not bring Your servant into judgment,
For the enemy has pursued my soul,
My spirit grows faint within me;
I remember the days of old;
I stretch out my hands to You;
Answer me quickly, O LORD;
Let me hear Your loving devotion in the morning,
Deliver me from my enemies, O LORD;
Teach me to do Your will,
For the sake of Your name, O LORD,
And in Your loving devotion,
