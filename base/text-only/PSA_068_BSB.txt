For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. A song.
As smoke is blown away,
But the righteous will be glad
Sing to God!
A father of the fatherless
God settles the lonely in families;
O God, when You went out before Your people,
the earth shook and the heavens poured down rain
You sent abundant rain, O God;
Your flock settled therein;
The Lord gives the command;
“Kings and their armies flee in haste;
Though you lie down among the sheepfolds,
When the Almighty
A mountain of God is Mount Bashan;
Why do you gaze in envy, O mountains of many peaks?
The chariots of God are tens of thousands —
You have ascended on high;
Blessed be the Lord,
Our God is a God of deliverance;
Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies,
The Lord said, “I will retrieve them from Bashan,
that your foot may be dipped
They have seen Your procession, O God —
The singers lead the way,
Bless God in the great congregation;
There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them,
Summon Your power, O God;
Because of Your temple at Jerusalem
Rebuke the beast in the reeds,
Envoys will arrive from Egypt;
Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth;
to Him who rides upon the highest heavens of old;
Ascribe the power to God,
O God, You are awesome in Your sanctuary;
