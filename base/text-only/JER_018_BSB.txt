This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
“Go down at once to the potter’s house, and there I will give you My message.”
So I went down to the potter’s house and saw him working at the wheel.
But the vessel that he was shaping from the clay became flawed in his hand; so he formed it into another vessel, as it seemed best for him to do.
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“O house of Israel, declares the LORD, can I not treat you as this potter treats his clay? Just like clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel.
At any time I might announce that a nation or kingdom will be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed.
But if that nation I warned turns from its evil, then I will relent of the disaster I had planned to bring.
And if at another time I announce that I will build up and establish a nation or kingdom,
and if it does evil in My sight and does not listen to My voice, then I will relent of the good I had intended for it.
Now therefore, tell the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem that this is what the LORD says: ‘Behold, I am planning a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways, and correct your ways and deeds.’
But they will reply, ‘It is hopeless. We will follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’”
Therefore this is what the LORD says:
Does the snow of Lebanon
Yet My people have forgotten Me.
They have made their land a desolation,
I will scatter them before the enemy
Then some said, “Come, let us make plans against Jeremiah, for the law will never be lost to the priest, nor counsel to the wise, nor an oracle to the prophet. Come, let us denounce him and pay no heed to any of his words.”
Attend to me, O LORD.
Should good be repaid with evil?
Therefore, hand their children over to famine;
Let a cry be heard from their houses
But You, O LORD, know all their deadly plots against me.
