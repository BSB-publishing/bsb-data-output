Hear this word, O house of Israel, this lamentation I take up against you:
“Fallen is Virgin Israel,
This is what the Lord GOD says:
For this is what the LORD says to the house of Israel:
Do not seek Bethel or go to Gilgal;
Seek the LORD and live,
There are those who turn justice into wormwood
He who made the Pleiades and Orion,
He flashes destruction on the strong,
There are those who hate the one who reproves in the gate
Therefore, because you trample on the poor
For I know that your transgressions are many
Therefore, the prudent keep silent in such times,
Seek good, not evil,
Hate evil and love good;
Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the Lord, says:
There will be wailing in all the vineyards,
Woe to you who long for the Day of the LORD!
It will be like a man who flees from a lion,
Will not the Day of the LORD
“I hate, I despise your feasts!
Even though you offer Me burnt offerings and grain offerings,
Take away from Me the noise of your songs!
But let justice roll on like a river,
Did you bring Me sacrifices and offerings
You have taken along Sakkuth your king
Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,”
