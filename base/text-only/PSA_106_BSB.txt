Hallelujah!
Who can describe the mighty acts of the LORD
Blessed are those who uphold justice,
Remember me, O LORD, in Your favor to Your people;
that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones,
We have sinned like our fathers;
Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp Your wonders
Yet He saved them for the sake of His name,
He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up;
He saved them from the hand that hated them;
The waters covered their foes;
Then they believed His promises
Yet they soon forgot His works
They craved intensely in the wilderness
So He granted their request,
In the camp they envied Moses,
The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan;
Then fire blazed through their company;
At Horeb
They exchanged their Glory
They forgot God their Savior,
wondrous works in the land of Ham,
So He said He would destroy them—
They despised the pleasant land;
They grumbled in their tents
So He raised His hand and swore
to disperse
They yoked themselves to Baal of Peor
So they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds,
But Phinehas stood and intervened,
It was credited to him as righteousness
At the waters of Meribah
For they rebelled against His Spirit,
They did not destroy the peoples
but they mingled with the nations
They worshiped their idols,
They sacrificed their sons
They shed innocent blood—
They defiled themselves by their actions
So the anger of the LORD burned against His people,
He delivered them into the hand of the nations,
Their enemies oppressed them
Many times He rescued them,
Nevertheless He heard their cry;
And He remembered His covenant with them,
He made them objects of compassion
Save us, O LORD our God,
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
