For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Death of the Son.” A Psalm of David.
I will be glad and rejoice in You;
When my enemies retreat,
For You have upheld my just cause;
You have rebuked the nations;
The enemy has come to eternal ruin,
But the LORD abides forever;
He judges the world with justice;
The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed,
Those who know Your name trust in You,
Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion;
For the Avenger of bloodshed remembers;
Be merciful to me, O LORD;
that I may declare all Your praises —
The nations have fallen into a pit of their making;
The LORD is known by the justice He brings;
The wicked will return to Sheol—
For the needy will not always be forgotten;
Rise up, O LORD, do not let man prevail;
Lay terror upon them, O LORD;
