For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
May He send you help from the sanctuary
May He remember all your gifts
May He give you the desires of your heart
May we shout for joy at your victory
Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed;
Some trust in chariots and others in horses,
They collapse and fall,
O LORD, save
