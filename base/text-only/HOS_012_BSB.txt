Ephraim
The LORD has a charge to bring against Judah.
In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel,
Yes, he struggled with the angel
the LORD God of Hosts,
But you must return to your God;
A merchant loves to defraud
And Ephraim boasts: “How rich I have become!
But I am the LORD your God
I spoke through the prophets
Is there iniquity in Gilead?
Jacob fled to the land of Aram
But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt,
Ephraim has provoked bitter anger,
