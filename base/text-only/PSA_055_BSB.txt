at the voice of the enemy,
My heart pounds within me,
Fear and trembling grip me,
I said, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove!
How far away I would flee!
I would hurry to my shelter,
O Lord, confuse and confound their speech,
Day and night they encircle the walls,
Destruction is within;
For it is not an enemy who insults me;
But it is you, a man like myself,
We shared sweet fellowship together;
Let death seize them by surprise;
But I call to God,
Morning, noon, and night, I cry out in distress,
He redeems my soul in peace
God will hear and humiliate them —
My companion attacks his friends;
His speech is smooth as butter,
Cast your burden upon the LORD
But You, O God, will bring them down
