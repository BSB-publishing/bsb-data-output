Oh, that my head were a spring of water,
If only I had a traveler’s lodge in the wilderness,
“They bend their tongues like bows;
“Let everyone guard against his neighbor;
Each one betrays his friend;
You dwell
Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
Their tongues are deadly arrows;
Should I not punish them for these things?
I will take up a weeping and wailing for the mountains,
“And I will make Jerusalem a heap of rubble,
Who is the man wise enough to understand this? To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may explain it? Why is the land destroyed and scorched like a desert, so no one can pass through it?
And the LORD answered, “It is because they have forsaken My law, which I set before them; they have not walked in it or obeyed My voice.
Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts and gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught them.”
Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will feed this people wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink.
I will scatter them among the nations that neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send a sword after them until I have finished them off.”
This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
Let them come quickly
For the sound of wailing
Now, O women, hear the word of the LORD.
For death has climbed in through our windows;
Declare that this is what the LORD says:
This is what the LORD says:
But let him who boasts boast in this,
“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh—
Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and all the inhabitants of the desert who clip the hair of their temples. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”
