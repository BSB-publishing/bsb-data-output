Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt:
“Only you have I known
Can two walk together
Does a lion roar in the forest
Does a bird land in a snare
If a ram’s horn sounds in a city,
Surely the Lord GOD does nothing
The lion has roared —
Proclaim to the citadels of Ashdod
“For they know not how to do right,”
Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
This is what the LORD says:
Hear and testify against the house of Jacob,
On the day I punish Israel for their transgressions,
I will tear down the winter house
