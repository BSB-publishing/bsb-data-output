The proverbs of Solomon:
Ill-gotten treasures profit nothing,
The LORD does not let the righteous go hungry,
Idle hands make one poor,
He who gathers in summer is a wise son,
Blessings are on the head of the righteous,
The memory of the righteous is a blessing,
A wise heart will receive commandments,
He who walks in integrity walks securely,
He who winks the eye causes grief,
The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life,
Hatred stirs up dissension,
Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning,
The wise store up knowledge,
The wealth of the rich man is his fortified city,
The labor of the righteous leads to life,
Whoever heeds instruction is on the path to life,
The one who conceals hatred has lying lips,
When words are many, sin is unavoidable,
The tongue of the righteous is choice silver,
The lips of the righteous feed many,
The blessing of the LORD enriches,
The fool delights in shameful conduct,
What the wicked man dreads will overtake him,
When the whirlwind passes, the wicked are no more,
Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,
The fear of the LORD prolongs life,
The hope of the righteous is joy,
The way of the LORD is a refuge to the upright,
The righteous will never be shaken,
The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom,
The lips of the righteous know what is fitting,
