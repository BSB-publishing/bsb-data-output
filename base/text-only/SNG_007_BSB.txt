How beautiful are your sandaled feet,
Your navel is a rounded goblet;
Your breasts are like two fawns,
Your neck is like a tower
Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel,
How fair and pleasant you are,
Your stature is like a palm tree;
I said, “I will climb the palm tree;
and your mouth
I belong to my beloved,
Come, my beloved,
Let us go early to the vineyards
The mandrakes send forth a fragrance,
