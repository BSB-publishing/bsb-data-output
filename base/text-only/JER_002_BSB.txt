Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem that this is what the LORD says:
Israel was holy to the LORD,
Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all you families of the house of Israel.
This is what the LORD says:
They did not ask, ‘Where is the LORD
I brought you into a fertile land
The priests did not ask,
Therefore, I will contend with you again,
Cross over to the coasts of Cyprus
Has a nation ever changed its gods?
Be stunned by this, O heavens;
“For My people have committed two evils:
Is Israel a slave?
The young lions have roared at him;
The men of Memphis
Have you not brought this on yourself
Now what will you gain on your way to Egypt
Your own evil will discipline you;
“For long ago you broke your yoke
I had planted you like a choice vine
Although you wash with lye
“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled;
a wild donkey at home in the wilderness,
You should have kept your feet from going bare
As the thief is ashamed when he is caught,
say to a tree, ‘You are my father,’
But where are the gods you made for yourselves?
Why do you bring a case against Me?
“I have struck your sons in vain;
You people of this generation, consider the word of the LORD:
Does a maiden forget her jewelry
How skillfully you pursue love!
Moreover, your skirts are stained
you say, ‘I am innocent.
How impulsive you are,
Moreover, you will leave that place
