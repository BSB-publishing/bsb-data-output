“As for you, take up a lament for the princes of Israel
and say:
She brought up one of her cubs,
When the nations heard of him,
When she saw that she had waited in vain,
He prowled among the lions,
He broke down their strongholds
Then the nations set out against him
With hooks they caged him
Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard,
It had strong branches, fit for a ruler’s scepter.
But it was uprooted in fury,
Now it is planted in the wilderness,
Fire has gone out from its main branch
