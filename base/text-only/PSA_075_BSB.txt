For the choirmaster: To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Psalm of Asaph. A song.
“When I choose a time,
When the earth and all its dwellers quake,
I say to the proud, ‘Do not boast,’
Do not lift up your horn against heaven
For exaltation comes neither from east nor west,
but it is God who judges;
For a cup is in the hand of the LORD,
But I will proclaim Him
“All the horns of the wicked I will cut off,
