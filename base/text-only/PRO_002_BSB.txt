My son, if you accept my words
if you incline your ear to wisdom
if you truly call out to insight
if you seek it like silver
then you will discern the fear of the LORD
For the LORD gives wisdom;
He stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
to guard the paths of justice
Then you will discern righteousness
For wisdom will enter your heart,
Discretion will watch over you,
to deliver you from the way of evil,
from those who leave the straight paths
from those who enjoy doing evil
whose paths are crooked
It will rescue you from the forbidden woman,
who abandons the partner of her youth
For her house sinks down to death,
None who go to her return
So you will follow in the ways of the good,
For the upright will inhabit the land,
but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
