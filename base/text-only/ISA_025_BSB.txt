O LORD, You are my God!
Indeed, You have made the city a heap of rubble,
Therefore, a strong people will honor You.
For You have been a refuge for the poor,
like heat in a dry land.
On this mountain the LORD of Hosts
On this mountain He will swallow up
He will swallow up death forever.
And in that day it will be said, “Surely this is our God;
For the hand of the LORD
He will spread out his hands within it,
The high-walled fortress will be brought down,
