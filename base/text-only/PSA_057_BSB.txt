For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam
I cry out to God Most High,
He reaches down from heaven and saves me;
My soul is among the lions;
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
They spread a net for my feet;
My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast.
Awake, my glory!
I will praise You, O Lord, among the nations;
For Your loving devotion reaches to the heavens,
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
