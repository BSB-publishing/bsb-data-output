“Cry aloud, do not hold back!
For day after day they seek Me
“Why have we fasted,
You fast with contention and strife
Is this the fast I have chosen:
Isn’t this the fast that I have chosen:
Isn’t it to share your bread with the hungry,
Then your light will break forth like the dawn,
Then you will call, and the LORD will answer;
and if you give yourself to the hungry
The LORD will always guide you;
Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins;
If you turn your foot from breaking the Sabbath,
then you will delight yourself in the LORD,
