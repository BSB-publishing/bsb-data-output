My son, keep my words
Keep my commandments and live;
Tie them to your fingers;
Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
that they may keep you from the adulteress,
For at the window of my house
I saw among the simple,
crossing the street near her corner,
at twilight, as the day was fading
Then a woman came out to meet him,
She is loud and defiant;
Now in the street, now in the squares,
She seizes him and kisses him;
“I have made my peace offerings;
So I came out to meet you;
I have decked my bed with coverings,
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh,
Come, let us take our fill of love till morning.
For my husband is not at home;
He took with him a bag of money
With her great persuasion she entices him;
He follows her on impulse,
until an arrow pierces his liver,
Now, my sons, listen to me,
Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways;
For she has brought many down to death;
Her house is the road to Sheol,
