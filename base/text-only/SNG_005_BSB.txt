I have come to my garden, my sister, my bride;
I sleep, but my heart is awake.
I have taken off my robe —
My beloved put his hand to the latch;
I rose up to open for my beloved.
I opened for my beloved,
I encountered the watchmen on their rounds of the city.
O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you,
How is your beloved better than others,
My beloved is dazzling and ruddy,
His head is purest gold;
His eyes are like doves
His cheeks are like beds of spice,
His arms are rods of gold
His legs are pillars of marble
His mouth
