This is the word of the LORD about the nations— the word that came to Jeremiah the prophet
concerning Egypt and the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah:
“Deploy your shields, small and large;
Harness the horses; mount the steeds;
Why am I seeing this?
“The swift cannot flee,
Who is this, rising like the Nile,
Egypt rises like the Nile,
Advance, O horses! Race furiously, O chariots!
For that day belongs to the Lord GOD of Hosts,
Go up to Gilead for balm,
The nations have heard of your shame,
This is the word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to strike the land of Egypt:
“Announce it in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol;
Why have your warriors been laid low?
They continue to stumble;
There they will cry out:
As surely as I live, declares the King,
Pack your bags for exile,
Egypt is a beautiful heifer,
Even the mercenaries among her
Egypt will hiss like a fleeing serpent,
They will chop down her forest, declares the LORD,
The Daughter of Egypt will be put to shame;
The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I am about to punish Amon god of Thebes,
I will deliver them into the hands of those who seek their lives— of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. But after this, Egypt will be inhabited as in days of old, declares the LORD.
But you, O Jacob My servant, do not be afraid,
And you, My servant Jacob, do not be afraid,
