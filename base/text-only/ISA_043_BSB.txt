But now, this is what the LORD says—
When you pass through the waters,
For I am the LORD your God,
Because you are precious and honored in My sight,
Do not be afraid, for I am with you;
I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’
everyone called by My name and created for My glory,
Bring out a people who have eyes but are blind,
All the nations gather together
“You are My witnesses,” declares the LORD,
I, yes I, am the LORD,
I alone decreed and saved and proclaimed—
Even from eternity I am He,
Thus says the LORD your Redeemer,
I am the LORD, your Holy One,
Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea
who brings out the chariots and horses,
“Do not call to mind the former things;
Behold, I am about to do something new;
The beasts of the field will honor Me,
The people I formed for Myself
But you have not called on Me, O Jacob,
You have not brought Me sheep for burnt offerings,
You have not bought Me sweet cane with your silver,
I, yes I, am He
Remind Me, let us argue the matter together.
Your first father sinned,
So I will disgrace the princes of your sanctuary,
