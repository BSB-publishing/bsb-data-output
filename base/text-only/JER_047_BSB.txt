This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet about the Philistines before Pharaoh struck down Gaza.
This is what the LORD says:
at the sound of the galloping hooves of stallions,
For the day has come
The people of Gaza will shave their heads in mourning;
‘Alas, O sword of the LORD,
How can it rest
