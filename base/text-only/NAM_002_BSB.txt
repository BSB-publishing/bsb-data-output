One who scatters advances
For the LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob
The shields of his mighty men are red;
The chariots dash through the streets;
He summons his nobles;
The river gates are thrown open
It is decreed that the city be exiled
Nineveh has been like a pool of water
“Plunder the silver!
She is emptied!
Where is the lions’ lair
The lion mauled enough for its cubs
“Behold, I am against you,”
