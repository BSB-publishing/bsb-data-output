After this I saw another angel descending from heaven with great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his glory.
And he cried out in a mighty voice:
All the nations have drunk
Then I heard another voice from heaven say:
For her sins are piled up to heaven,
Give back to her as she has done to others;
As much as she has glorified herself and lived in luxury,
Therefore her plagues will come in one day —
Then the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail at the sight of the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her.
In fear of her torment, they will stand at a distance and cry out:
And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, because there is no one left to buy their cargo —
cargo of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; of fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet; of all kinds of citron wood and every article of ivory, precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble;
of cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, and frankincense; of wine, olive oil, fine flour, and wheat; of cattle, sheep, horses, and carriages; of bodies and souls of slaves.
And they will say:
The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand at a distance, in fear of her torment. They will weep and mourn,
saying:
For in a single hour
and cry out at the sight of the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her. “What city was ever like this great city?” they will exclaim.
Then they will throw dust on their heads as they weep and mourn and cry out:
Rejoice over her, O heaven,
Then a mighty angel picked up a stone the size of a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying:
And the sound of harpists and musicians,
The light of a lamp
And there was found in her the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who had been slain on the earth.
