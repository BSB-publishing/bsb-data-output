A Maskil
Remember Your congregation,
Turn Your steps to the everlasting ruins,
Your foes have roared within Your meeting place;
like men wielding axes in a thicket of trees
and smashing all the carvings with hatchets and picks.
They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground;
They said in their hearts,
There are no signs for us to see.
How long, O God, will the enemy taunt You?
Why do You withdraw Your strong right hand?
Yet God is my King from ancient times,
You divided the sea by Your strength;
You crushed the heads of Leviathan;
You broke open the fountain and the flood;
The day is Yours, and also the night;
You set all the boundaries of the earth;
Remember how the enemy has mocked You, O LORD,
Do not deliver the soul of Your dove to beasts;
Consider Your covenant,
Do not let the oppressed retreat in shame;
Rise up, O God; defend Your cause!
Do not disregard the clamor of Your adversaries,
