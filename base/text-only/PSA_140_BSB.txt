For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
who devise evil in their hearts
They sharpen their tongues like snakes;
Guard me, O LORD,
The proud hide a snare for me;
I say to the LORD, “You are my God.”
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation,
Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked;
May the heads of those who surround me
May burning coals fall on them;
May no slanderer be established in the land;
I know that the LORD upholds justice for the poor
Surely the righteous will praise Your name;
