Remember your Creator in the days of your youth,
before the light of the sun, moon, and stars is darkened,
on the day the keepers of the house tremble
when the doors to the street are shut
when men fear the heights and dangers of the road,
Remember Him before the silver cord is snapped
before the dust returns to the ground from which it came
“Futility of futilities,” says the Teacher.
Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also taught the people knowledge; he pondered, searched out, and arranged many proverbs.
The Teacher searched to find delightful sayings and to record accurate words of truth.
The words of the wise are like goads, and the anthologies of the masters are like firmly embedded nails driven by a single Shepherd.
And by these, my son, be further warned: There is no end to the making of many books, and much study wearies the body.
When all has been heard, the conclusion of the matter is this: Fear God and keep His commandments, because this is the whole duty of man.
For God will bring every deed into judgment, along with every hidden thing, whether good or evil.
