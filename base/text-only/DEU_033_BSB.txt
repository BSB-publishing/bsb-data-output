This is the blessing that Moses the man of God pronounced upon the Israelites before his death.
He said:
Surely You love the people;
the law that Moses gave us,
So the LORD became King in Jeshurun
Let Reuben live and not die,
And concerning Judah he said:
Concerning Levi he said:
He said of his father and mother,
He will teach Your ordinances to Jacob
Bless his substance, O LORD,
Concerning Benjamin he said:
Concerning Joseph he said:
with the bountiful harvest from the sun
with the best of the ancient mountains
with the choice gifts of the land and everything in it,
His majesty is like a firstborn bull,
Concerning Zebulun he said:
They will call the peoples to a mountain;
Concerning Gad he said:
He chose the best land for himself,
Concerning Dan he said:
Concerning Naphtali he said:
And concerning Asher he said:
May the bolts of your gate be iron and bronze,
“There is none like the God of Jeshurun,
The eternal God is your dwelling place,
So Israel dwells securely;
Blessed are you, O Israel!
