For the choirmaster. Of David the servant of the LORD, who sang this song to the LORD on the day the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:
The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer.
I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised;
The cords of death encompassed me;
The cords of Sheol entangled me;
In my distress I called upon the LORD;
Then the earth shook and quaked,
Smoke rose from His nostrils,
He parted the heavens and came down
He mounted a cherub and flew;
He made darkness His hiding place,
From the brightness of His presence
The LORD thundered from heaven;
He shot His arrows and scattered the foes;
The channels of the sea appeared,
He reached down from on high and took hold of me;
He rescued me from my powerful enemy,
They confronted me in my day of calamity,
He brought me out into the open;
The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness;
For I have kept the ways of the LORD
For all His ordinances are before me;
And I have been blameless before Him
So the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness,
To the faithful You show Yourself faithful,
to the pure You show Yourself pure,
For You save an afflicted people,
For You, O LORD, light my lamp;
For in You I can charge an army,
As for God, His way is perfect;
For who is God besides the LORD?
It is God who arms me with strength
He makes my feet like those of a deer
He trains my hands for battle;
You have given me Your shield of salvation;
You broaden the path beneath me
I pursued my enemies and overtook them;
I crushed them so they could not rise;
You have armed me with strength for battle;
You have made my enemies retreat before me;
They cried for help, but there was no one to save them —
I ground them as dust in the face of the wind;
You have delivered me from the strife of the people;
When they hear me, they obey me;
Foreigners lose heart
The LORD lives, and blessed be my Rock!
the God who avenges me
who delivers me from my enemies.
Therefore I will praise You, O LORD, among the nations;
Great salvation He brings to His king.
