For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. A song.
O You who listen to prayer,
When iniquities prevail against me,
Blessed is the one You choose
With awesome deeds of righteousness You answer us,
You formed the mountains by Your power,
You stilled the roaring of the seas,
Those who live far away fear Your wonders;
You attend to the earth and water it;
You soak its furrows and level its ridges;
You crown the year with Your bounty,
The pastures of the wilderness overflow;
The pastures are clothed with flocks,
