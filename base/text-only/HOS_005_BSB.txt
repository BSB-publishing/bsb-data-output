“Hear this, O priests!
The rebels are deep in slaughter;
I know all about Ephraim,
Their deeds do not permit them
Israel’s arrogance testifies against them;
They go with their flocks and herds
They have been unfaithful to the LORD;
Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah,
Ephraim will be laid waste
The princes of Judah
Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment,
So I am like a moth to Ephraim,
When Ephraim saw his sickness
For I am like a lion to Ephraim
Then I will return to My place
