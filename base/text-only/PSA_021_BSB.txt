For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
You have granted his heart’s desire
For You welcomed him with rich blessings;
He asked You for life, and You granted it—
Great is his glory in Your salvation;
For You grant him blessings forever;
For the king trusts in the LORD;
Your hand will apprehend all Your enemies;
You will place them in a fiery furnace
You will wipe their descendants from the earth,
Though they intend You harm,
For You will put them to flight
Be exalted, O LORD, in Your strength;
