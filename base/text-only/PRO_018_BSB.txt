He who isolates himself pursues selfish desires;
A fool does not delight in understanding,
With a wicked man comes contempt as well,
The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters;
Showing partiality
A fool’s lips bring him strife,
A fool’s mouth is his ruin,
The words of a gossip are like choice morsels
Whoever is slothful in his work
The name of the LORD is a strong tower;
A rich man’s wealth is his fortified city;
Before his downfall a man’s heart is proud,
He who answers a matter before he hears it—
The spirit of a man can endure his sickness,
The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge,
A man’s gift opens doors for him,
The first to state his case seems right
Casting the lot ends quarrels
An offended brother is harder to win than a fortified city,
From the fruit of his mouth a man’s belly is filled;
Life and death are in the power of the tongue,
He who finds a wife finds a good thing
The poor man pleads for mercy,
A man of many companions may come to ruin,
