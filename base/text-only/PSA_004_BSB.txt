For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.
How long, O men, will my honor be maligned?
Know that the LORD has set apart the godly for Himself;
Be angry, yet do not sin;
Offer the sacrifices of the righteous
Many ask, “Who can show us the good?”
You have filled my heart with more joy
I will lie down and sleep in peace,
