In that day the LORD will take His sharp, great, and mighty sword, and bring judgment on Leviathan the fleeing serpent
In that day:
I, the LORD, am its keeper;
I am not angry.
Or let them lay claim to My protection;
In the days to come, Jacob will take root.
Has the LORD struck Israel as He struck her oppressors?
By warfare and exile
Therefore Jacob’s guilt will be atoned for,
For the fortified city lies deserted —
When its limbs are dry,
In that day the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates
And in that day a great ram’s horn will sound, and those who were perishing in Assyria will come forth with those who were exiles in Egypt. And they will worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
