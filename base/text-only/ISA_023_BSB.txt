This is the burden against Tyre:
Be silent, O dwellers of the coastland,
On the great waters
Be ashamed, O Sidon, the stronghold of the sea,
When the report reaches Egypt,
Cross over to Tarshish;
Is this your jubilant city,
Who planned this against Tyre,
The LORD of Hosts planned it,
Cultivate
The LORD has stretched out His hand over the sea;
He said, “You shall rejoice no more,
Look at the land of the Chaldeans
Wail, O ships of Tarshish,
At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years— the span of a king’s life. But at the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:
“Take up your harp,
And at the end of seventy years, the LORD will restore Tyre. Then she will return to hire as a prostitute and sell herself to all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
Yet her profits and wages will be set apart to the LORD; they will not be stored or saved, for her profit will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothing.
