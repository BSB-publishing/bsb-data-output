For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
For wicked and deceitful mouths open against me;
They surround me with hateful words
In return for my love they accuse me,
They repay me evil for good,
Set over him a wicked man;
When he is tried, let him be found guilty,
May his days be few;
May his children be fatherless
May his children wander as beggars,
May the creditor seize all he owns,
May there be no one to extend kindness to him,
May his descendants be cut off;
May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD,
May their sins always remain before the LORD,
For he never thought to show kindness,
The cursing that he loved,
The cursing that he wore like a coat,
May it be like a robe wrapped about him,
May this be the LORD’s reward to my accusers,
But You, O GOD, the Lord,
For I am poor and needy;
I am fading away like a lengthening shadow;
My knees are weak from fasting,
I am an object of scorn to my accusers;
Help me, O LORD my God;
Let them know that this is Your hand,
Though they curse, You will bless.
May my accusers be clothed with disgrace;
With my mouth I will thank the LORD profusely;
For He stands at the right hand of the needy one,
