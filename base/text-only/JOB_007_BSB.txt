“Is not man consigned to labor on earth?
Like a slave he longs for shade;
So I am allotted months of futility,
When I lie down I think:
My flesh is clothed with worms
My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle;
Remember that my life is but a breath.
The eye that beholds me will no longer see me.
As a cloud vanishes and is gone,
He never returns to his house;
Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;
Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep,
When I think my bed will comfort me
then You frighten me with dreams
so that I would prefer strangling and death
I loathe my life! I would not live forever.
What is man that You should exalt him,
that You attend to him every morning,
Will You never look away from me,
If I have sinned, what have I done to You,
Why do You not pardon my transgression
