“But now, O Job, hear my speech,
Behold, I will open my mouth;
My words are from an upright heart,
The Spirit of God has made me,
Refute me if you can;
I am just like you before God;
Surely no fear of me should terrify you;
Surely you have spoken in my hearing,
‘I am pure, without transgression;
Yet God finds occasions against me;
He puts my feet in the stocks;
Behold, you are not right in this matter.
Why do you complain to Him
For God speaks in one way and in another,
In a dream,
He opens their ears
to turn a man from wrongdoing
to preserve his soul from the Pit
A man is also chastened on his bed
so that he detests his bread,
His flesh wastes away from sight,
He draws near to the Pit,
Yet if there is a messenger on his side,
to be gracious to him and say,
then his flesh is refreshed like a child’s;
He prays to God and finds favor;
Then he sings before
He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit,
Behold, all these things God does to a man,
to bring back his soul from the Pit,
Pay attention, Job, and listen to me;
But if you have something to say, answer me;
But if not, then listen to me;
