A song. A Psalm of David.
Awake, O harp and lyre!
I will praise You, O LORD, among the nations;
For Your loving devotion extends beyond the heavens,
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
Respond and save us with Your right hand,
God has spoken from His sanctuary:
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine;
Moab is My washbasin;
Who will bring me to the fortified city?
Have You not rejected us, O God?
Give us aid against the enemy,
With God we will perform with valor,
