In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
Open the gates so a righteous nation may enter—
You will keep in perfect peace the steadfast of mind,
Trust in the LORD forever,
For He has humbled those who dwell on high;
Feet trample it down —
The path of the righteous is level;
Yes, we wait for You, O LORD;
My soul longs for You in the night;
Though grace is shown to the wicked man,
O LORD, Your hand is upraised,
O LORD, You will establish peace for us.
O LORD our God, other lords besides You have ruled over us,
The dead will not live;
You have enlarged the nation, O LORD;
O LORD, they sought You in their distress;
As a woman with child about to give birth
We were with child; we writhed in pain;
Your dead will live; their bodies will rise.
Go, my people, enter your rooms
For behold, the LORD is coming out of His dwelling
