For the choirmaster. According to Gittith.
Lift up a song, strike the tambourine,
Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon,
For this is a statute for Israel,
He ordained it as a testimony for Joseph
“I relieved his shoulder of the burden;
You called out in distress, and I rescued you;
Hear, O My people, and I will warn you:
There must be no strange god among you,
I am the LORD your God,
But My people would not listen to Me,
So I gave them up to their stubborn hearts
If only My people would listen to Me,
how soon I would subdue their enemies
Those who hate the LORD would feign obedience,
But I would feed you the finest wheat;
