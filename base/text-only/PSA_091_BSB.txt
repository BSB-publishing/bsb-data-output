He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
I will say to the LORD, “You are my refuge and my fortress,
Surely He will deliver you
He will cover you with His feathers;
You will not fear the terror of the night,
nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness,
Though a thousand may fall at your side,
You will only see it with your eyes
Because you have made the LORD your dwelling—
no evil will befall you,
For He will command His angels concerning you
They will lift you up in their hands,
You will tread on the lion and cobra;
“Because he loves Me, I will deliver him;
When he calls out to Me,
With long life I will satisfy him
