Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD;
Let us enter His presence with thanksgiving;
For the LORD is a great God,
In His hand are the depths of the earth,
The sea is His, for He made it,
O come, let us worship and bow down;
For He is our God,
do not harden your hearts
where your fathers tested and tried Me,
For forty years I was angry with that generation,
So I swore on oath in My anger,
