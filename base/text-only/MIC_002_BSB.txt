Woe to those who devise iniquity
They covet fields and seize them;
Therefore this is what the LORD says:
In that day they will take up a proverb against you
Therefore, you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD
“Do not preach,” they preach.
Should it be said, O house of Jacob,
But of late My people have risen up
You drive the women of My people
Arise and depart,
If a man of wind were to come
I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob;
One who breaks open the way
