From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the LORD his God,
saying:
For You cast me into the deep,
At this, I said,
The waters engulfed me
To the roots of the mountains I descended;
As my life was fading away,
Those who cling to worthless idols
But I, with the voice of thanksgiving,
And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
