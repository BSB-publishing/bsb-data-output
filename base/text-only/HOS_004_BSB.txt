Hear the word of the LORD,
Cursing and lying,
Therefore the land mourns,
But let no man contend;
You will stumble by day,
My people are destroyed
The more they multiplied,
They feed on the sins
And it shall be
They will eat but not be satisfied;
to promiscuity, wine, and new wine,
My people consult their wooden idols,
They sacrifice on the mountaintops
I will not punish your daughters
Though you prostitute yourself, O Israel,
For Israel is as obstinate
Ephraim
When their liquor is gone,
The whirlwind has wrapped them
