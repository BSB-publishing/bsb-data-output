Send the tribute lambs
Like fluttering birds
“Give us counsel;
Let my fugitives stay with you;
in loving devotion
We have heard of Moab’s pomposity,
Therefore let Moab wail;
For the fields of Heshbon have withered,
So I weep with Jazer
Joy and gladness are removed from the orchard;
Therefore my heart laments for Moab like a harp,
When Moab appears on the high place,
This is the message that the LORD spoke earlier concerning Moab.
And now the LORD says, “In three years, as a hired worker counts the years, Moab’s splendor will become an object of contempt, with all her many people. And those who are left will be few and feeble.”
