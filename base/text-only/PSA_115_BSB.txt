Not to us, O LORD, not to us,
Why should the nations say,
Our God is in heaven;
Their idols are silver and gold,
They have mouths, but cannot speak;
they have ears, but cannot hear;
they have hands, but cannot feel;
Those who make them become like them,
O Israel,
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD!
You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD!
The LORD is mindful of us;
He will bless those who fear the LORD—
May the LORD give you increase,
May you be blessed by the LORD,
The highest heavens belong to the LORD,
It is not the dead who praise the LORD,
But it is we who will bless the LORD,
