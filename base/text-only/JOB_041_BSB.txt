“Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook
Can you put a cord through his nose
Will he beg you for mercy
Will he make a covenant with you
Can you pet him like a bird
Will traders barter for him
Can you fill his hide with harpoons
If you lay a hand on him,
Surely hope of overcoming him is false.
No one is so fierce as to rouse Leviathan.
Who has given to Me that I should repay him?
I cannot keep silent about his limbs,
Who can strip off his outer coat?
Who can open his jaws,
His rows of scales are his pride,
One scale is so near to another
They are joined to one another;
His snorting flashes with light,
Firebrands stream from his mouth;
Smoke billows from his nostrils
His breath sets coals ablaze,
Strength resides in his neck,
The folds of his flesh are tightly joined;
His chest is as hard as a rock,
When Leviathan rises up, the mighty are terrified;
The sword that reaches him has no effect,
He regards iron as straw
No arrow can make him flee;
A club is regarded as straw,
His undersides are jagged potsherds,
He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron;
He leaves a glistening wake behind him;
Nothing on earth is his equal—
He looks down on all the haughty;
