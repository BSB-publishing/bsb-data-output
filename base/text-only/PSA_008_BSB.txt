For the choirmaster. According to Gittith.
From the mouths of children and infants
When I behold Your heavens,
what is man that You are mindful of him,
You made him a little lower than the angels;
You made him ruler of the works of Your hands;
all sheep and oxen,
the birds of the air and the fish of the sea,
O LORD, our Lord,
