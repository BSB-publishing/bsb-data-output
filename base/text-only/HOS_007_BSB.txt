When I heal Israel,
But they fail to consider in their hearts
They delight the king with their evil,
They are all adulterers,
The princes are inflamed with wine
For they prepare their heart like an oven
All of them are hot as an oven,
Ephraim mixes with the nations;
Foreigners consume his strength,
Israel’s arrogance testifies against them,
So Ephraim has become like a silly, senseless dove —
As they go, I will spread My net over them;
Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me!
They do not cry out to Me from their hearts
Although I trained and strengthened their arms,
They turn, but not to the Most High;
