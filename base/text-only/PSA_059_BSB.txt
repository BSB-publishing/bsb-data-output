For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam
Deliver me from workers of iniquity,
See how they lie in wait for me.
For no fault of my own,
O LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel,
They return in the evening, snarling like dogs
See what they spew from their mouths—
But You, O LORD, laugh at them;
I will keep watch for You, O my strength,
My God of loving devotion will come to meet me;
Do not kill them,
By the sins of their mouths
Consume them in wrath;
They return in the evening,
They scavenge for food,
But I will sing of Your strength
To You, O my strength, I sing praises,
