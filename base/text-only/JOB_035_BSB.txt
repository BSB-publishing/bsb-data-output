And Elihu went on to say:
“Do you think this is just?
For you ask, ‘What does it profit me,
I will reply to you
Look to the heavens and see;
If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him?
If you are righteous, what do you give Him,
Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself,
Men cry out under great oppression;
But no one asks, ‘Where is God my Maker,
who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth
There they cry out, but He does not answer,
Surely God does not listen to empty pleas,
How much less, then, when you say that you do not see Him,
and further, that in His anger He has not punished
So Job opens his mouth in vain
