“My spirit is broken; my days are extinguished;
Surely mockers surround me,
Give me, I pray, the pledge You demand.
You have closed their minds to understanding;
If a man denounces his friends for a price,
He has made me a byword among the people,
My eyes have grown dim with grief,
The upright are appalled at this,
Yet a righteous one holds to his way,
But come back and try again, all of you.
My days have passed; my plans are broken off —
They have turned night into day,
If I look for Sheol as my home,
and say to corruption, ‘You are my father,’
where then is my hope?
Will it go down to the gates of Sheol?
