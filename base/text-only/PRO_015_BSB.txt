A gentle answer turns away wrath,
The tongue of the wise commends knowledge,
The eyes of the LORD are in every place,
A soothing tongue is a tree of life,
A fool rejects his father’s discipline,
The house of the righteous has great treasure,
The lips of the wise spread knowledge,
The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable to the LORD,
The LORD detests the way of the wicked,
Discipline is harsh for him who leaves the path;
Sheol and Abaddon
A mocker does not love to be reproved,
A joyful heart makes a cheerful countenance,
A discerning heart seeks knowledge,
All the days of the oppressed are bad,
Better a little with the fear of the LORD
Better a dish of vegetables where there is love
A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,
The way of the slacker is like a hedge of thorns,
A wise son brings joy to his father,
Folly is joy to one who lacks judgment,
Plans fail for lack of counsel,
A man takes joy in a fitting reply —
The path of life leads upward for the wise,
The LORD tears down the house of the proud,
The LORD detests the thoughts of the wicked,
He who is greedy for unjust gain brings trouble on his household,
The heart of the righteous ponders how to answer,
The LORD is far from the wicked,
The light of the eyes cheers the heart,
He who listens to life-giving reproof
He who ignores discipline despises himself,
The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom,
