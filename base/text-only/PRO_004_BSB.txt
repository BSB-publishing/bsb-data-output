Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction;
For I give you sound teaching;
When I was a son to my father,
he taught me and said,
Get wisdom, get understanding;
Do not forsake wisdom, and she will preserve you;
Wisdom is supreme; so acquire wisdom.
Prize her, and she will exalt you;
She will set a garland of grace on your head;
Listen, my son, and receive my words,
I will guide you in the way of wisdom;
When you walk, your steps will not be impeded;
Hold on to instruction; do not let go.
Do not set foot on the path of the wicked
Avoid it; do not travel on it.
For they cannot sleep
For they eat the bread of wickedness
The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn,
But the way of the wicked is like the darkest gloom;
My son, pay attention to my words;
Do not lose sight of them;
For they are life to those who find them,
Guard your heart with all diligence,
Put away deception from your mouth;
Let your eyes look forward;
Make a level path for your feet,
Do not swerve to the right or to the left;
