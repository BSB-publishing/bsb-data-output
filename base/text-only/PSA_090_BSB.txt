A prayer of Moses the man of God.
Before the mountains were born
You return man to dust,
For in Your sight a thousand years
You sweep them away in their sleep;
in the morning it springs up new,
For we are consumed by Your anger
You have set our iniquities before You,
For all our days decline in Your fury;
The length of our days is seventy years —
Who knows the power of Your anger?
So teach us to number our days,
Return, O LORD! How long will it be?
Satisfy us in the morning with Your loving devotion,
Make us glad for as many days as You have afflicted us,
May Your work be shown to Your servants,
May the favor
