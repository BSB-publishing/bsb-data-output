The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice;
Clouds and darkness surround Him;
Fire goes before Him
His lightning illuminates the world;
The mountains melt like wax
The heavens proclaim His righteousness;
All worshipers of images are put to shame —
Zion hears and rejoices,
For You, O LORD, are Most High over all the earth;
Hate evil, O you who love the LORD!
Light shines
Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous ones,
