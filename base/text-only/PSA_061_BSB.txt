For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. Of David.
From the ends of the earth I call out to You
For You have been my refuge,
Let me dwell in Your tent forever
For You have heard my vows, O God;
Increase the days of the king’s life;
May he sit enthroned in God’s presence forever;
Then I will ever sing praise to Your name
