How beautiful you are, my darling—
Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn sheep
Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon,
Your neck is like the tower of David,
Your breasts are like two fawns,
Before the day breaks and the shadows flee,
You are altogether beautiful, my darling;
Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,
You have captured my heart,
How delightful is your love,
Your lips, my bride,
My sister, my bride, you are a garden locked up,
Your branches are an orchard of pomegranates
with nard and saffron, with calamus and cinnamon,
You are a garden spring,
Awake, O north wind,
