The descendants of Simeon:
The sons of Shaul:
The sons of Mishma:
Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but his brothers did not have many children, so their whole clan did not become as numerous as the sons of Judah.
They lived in Beersheba, Moladah, Hazar-shual,
Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad,
Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag,
Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susim, Beth-biri, and Shaaraim. These were their cities until the reign of David.
And their villages were Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Tochen, and Ashan— five towns—
and all their surrounding villages as far as Baal.
Meshobab, Jamlech, Joshah son of Amaziah,
Joel, Jehu son of Joshibiah (son of Seraiah, son of Asiel),
Elioenai, Jaakobah, Jeshohaiah, Asaiah, Adiel, Jesimiel, Benaiah,
and Ziza son of Shiphi (son of Allon, son of Jedaiah, son of Shimri, son of Shemaiah).
These men listed by name were the leaders of their clans. Their families increased greatly,
and they journeyed to the entrance of Gedor, to the east side of the valley, in search of pasture for their flocks.
There they found rich, good pasture, and the land was spacious, peaceful, and quiet; for some Hamites had lived there formerly.
These who were noted by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. They attacked the Hamites in their dwellings as well as the Meunites who were there, devoting them to destruction
And five hundred of these Simeonites led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, went to Mount Seir
and struck down the remnant of the Amalekites who had escaped. And they have lived there to this day.
