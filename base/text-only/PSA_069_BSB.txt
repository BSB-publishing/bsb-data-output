For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of David.
I have sunk into the miry depths,
I am weary from my crying;
Those who hate me without cause
You know my folly, O God,
May those who hope in You not be ashamed through me,
For I have endured scorn for Your sake,
I have become a stranger to my brothers
because zeal for Your house has consumed me,
I wept and fasted,
I made sackcloth my clothing,
Those who sit at the gate mock me,
But my prayer to You, O LORD,
Rescue me from the mire
Do not let the floods engulf me
Answer me, O LORD,
Hide not Your face from Your servant,
Draw near to my soul and redeem me;
You know my reproach, my shame and disgrace.
Insults have broken my heart,
They poisoned my food with gall
May their table become a snare;
May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see,
Pour out Your wrath upon them,
May their place be deserted;
For they persecute the one You struck
Add iniquity to their iniquity;
May they be blotted out of the Book of Life
But I am in pain and distress;
I will praise God’s name in song
And this will please the LORD more than an ox,
The humble will see and rejoice.
For the LORD listens to the needy
Let heaven and earth praise Him,
For God will save Zion
The descendants of His servants will inherit it,
