Then the LORD said to me, “Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary
And I will appoint for Myself trustworthy witnesses— Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.”
And I had relations with the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. The LORD said to me, “Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
For before the boy knows how to cry ‘Father’ or ‘Mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”
And the LORD spoke to me further:
“Because this people has rejected
the Lord will surely bring against them
It will pour into Judah,
Huddle together,
Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted;
For this is what the LORD has spoken to me with a strong hand, instructing me not to walk in the way of this people:
“Do not call conspiracy
The LORD of Hosts is the One
And He will be a sanctuary —
Many will stumble over these;
Bind up the testimony
I will wait for the LORD,
Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me
When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists who whisper and mutter, shouldn’t a people consult their God instead? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?
To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.
They will roam the land, dejected and hungry. When they are famished, they will become enraged; and looking upward, they will curse their king and their God.
Then they will look to the earth and see only distress and darkness and the gloom of anguish. And they will be driven into utter darkness.
