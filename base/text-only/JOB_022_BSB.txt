Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
“Can a man be of use to God?
Does it delight the Almighty that you are righteous?
Is it for your reverence that He rebukes you
Is not your wickedness great?
For you needlessly demanded security from your brothers
You gave no water to the weary
while the land belonged to a mighty man,
You sent widows away empty-handed,
Therefore snares surround you,
it is so dark you cannot see,
Is not God as high as the heavens?
Yet you say: ‘What does God know?
Thick clouds veil Him so He does not see us
Will you stay on the ancient path
They were snatched away before their time,
They said to God, ‘Depart from us.
But it was He who filled their houses with good things;
The righteous see it and are glad;
‘Surely our foes are destroyed,
Reconcile now and be at peace with Him;
Receive instruction from His mouth,
If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored.
and consign your gold to the dust
then the Almighty will be your gold
Surely then you will delight in the Almighty
You will pray to Him, and He will hear you,
Your decisions will be carried out,
When men are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’
He will deliver even one who is not innocent,
