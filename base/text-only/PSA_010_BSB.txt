Why, O LORD, do You stand far off?
In pride the wicked pursue the needy;
For the wicked man boasts in the cravings of his heart;
In his pride the wicked man does not seek Him;
He is secure in his ways at all times;
He says to himself, “I will not be moved;
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit,
He lies in wait near the villages;
He lies in wait like a lion in a thicket;
They are crushed and beaten down;
He says to himself, “God has forgotten;
Arise, O LORD! Lift up Your hand, O God!
Why has the wicked man renounced God?
But You have regarded trouble and grief;
Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer;
The LORD is King forever and ever;
You have heard, O LORD, the desire of the humble;
to vindicate the fatherless and oppressed,
