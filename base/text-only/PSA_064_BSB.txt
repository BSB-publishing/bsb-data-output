For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
Hide me from the scheming of the wicked,
who sharpen their tongues like swords
ambushing the innocent in seclusion,
They hold fast to their evil purpose;
They devise injustice and say,
But God will shoot them with arrows;
They will be made to stumble,
Then all mankind will fear
Let the righteous rejoice in the LORD
