“Shout for joy, O barren woman,
“Enlarge the site of your tent,
For you will spread out to the right and left;
Do not be afraid, for you will not be put to shame;
For your husband is your Maker —
For the LORD has called you back,
“For a brief moment I forsook you,
In a surge of anger
“For to Me this is like the days of Noah,
Though the mountains may be removed
“O afflicted city, lashed by storms,
I will make your pinnacles of rubies,
Then all your sons will be taught by the LORD,
In righteousness you will be established,
If anyone attacks you, it is not from Me;
Behold, I have created the craftsman
No weapon formed against you shall prosper,
