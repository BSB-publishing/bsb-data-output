Woe to you, O Ariel,
And I will constrain Ariel,
I will camp in a circle around you;
You will be brought low,
But your many foes will be like fine dust,
you will be visited by the LORD of Hosts
All the many nations
as when a hungry man dreams he is eating,
Stop and be astonished;
For the LORD has poured out on you
And the entire vision will be to you like the words sealed in a scroll. If it is handed to someone to read, he will say, “I cannot, because it is sealed.”
Or if the scroll is handed to one unable to read, he will say, “I cannot read.”
Therefore the Lord said:
Therefore I will again confound these people
Woe to those who dig deep
You have turned things upside down,
In a very short time,
On that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll,
The humble will increase their joy in the LORD,
For the ruthless will vanish,
those who indict a man with a word,
Therefore the LORD who redeemed Abraham says of the house of Jacob:
For when he sees his children around him,
Then the wayward in spirit will come to understanding,
