This is the vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
Listen, O heavens, and give ear, O earth,
The ox knows its owner,
Alas, O sinful nation,
Why do you want more beatings?
From the sole of your foot to the top of your head,
Your land is desolate;
And the Daughter of Zion is abandoned
Unless the LORD of Hosts
Hear the word of the LORD,
“What good to Me is your multitude of sacrifices?”
When you come to appear before Me,
Bring your worthless offerings no more;
I hate your New Moons
When you spread out your hands in prayer,
Wash and cleanse yourselves.
Learn to do right;
“Come now, let us reason together,”
If you are willing and obedient,
But if you resist and rebel,
See how the faithful city has become a harlot!
Your silver has become dross;
Your rulers are rebels,
Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts,
I will turn My hand against you;
I will restore your judges as at first,
Zion will be redeemed with justice,
But rebels and sinners will together be shattered,
Surely you will be ashamed of the sacred oaks
For you will become like an oak whose leaves are withered,
The strong man will become tinder
