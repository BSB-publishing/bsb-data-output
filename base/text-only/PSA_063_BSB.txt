A Psalm of David, when he was in the Wilderness of Judah.
So I have seen You in the sanctuary
Because Your loving devotion is better than life,
So I will bless You as long as I live;
My soul is satisfied as with the richest of foods;
When I remember You on my bed,
For You are my help;
My soul clings to You;
But those who seek my life to destroy it
They will fall to the power of the sword;
But the king will rejoice in God;
