Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good;
Let the redeemed of the LORD say so,
and gathered from the lands,
Some wandered in desert wastelands,
They were hungry and thirsty;
Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble,
He led them on a straight path
Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion
For He satisfies the thirsty
Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
because they rebelled against the words of God
He humbled their hearts with hard labor;
Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble,
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death
Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion
For He has broken down the gates of bronze
Fools, in their rebellious ways,
They loathed all food
Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble,
He sent forth His word and healed them;
Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion
Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving
Others went out to sea in ships,
They saw the works of the LORD,
For He spoke and raised a tempest
They mounted up to the heavens, then sunk to the depths;
They reeled and staggered like drunkards,
Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble,
He calmed the storm to a whisper,
They rejoiced in the silence,
Let them give thanks to the LORD for His loving devotion
Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people
He turns rivers into deserts,
and fruitful land into fields of salt,
He turns a desert into pools of water
He causes the hungry to settle there,
They sow fields and plant vineyards
He blesses them, and they multiply greatly;
When they are decreased and humbled
He pours out contempt on the nobles
But He lifts the needy from affliction
The upright see and rejoice,
Let him who is wise pay heed to these things
