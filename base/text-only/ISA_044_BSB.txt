But now listen, O Jacob My servant,
This is the word of the LORD, your Maker,
For I will pour water on the thirsty land,
They will sprout among the grass
One will say, ‘I belong to the LORD,’
Thus says the LORD,
Who then is like Me?
Do not tremble or fear.
All makers of idols are nothing,
Who fashions a god or casts an idol
Behold, all his companions will be put to shame,
The blacksmith takes a tool
The woodworker extends a measuring line;
He cuts down cedars
It serves as fuel for man.
He burns half of it in the fire,
From the rest he makes a god, his graven image.
They do not comprehend or discern,
And no one considers in his heart,
He feeds on ashes.
Remember these things, O Jacob,
I have blotted out your transgressions like a cloud,
Sing for joy, O heavens, for the LORD has done this;
Thus says the LORD,
who foils the signs of false prophets
who confirms the message of His servant
who says to the depths of the sea,
who says of Cyrus,
