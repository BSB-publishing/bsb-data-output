Of David.
in You, my God, I trust.
Surely none who wait for You will be put to shame;
Show me Your ways, O LORD;
Guide me in Your truth and teach me,
Remember, O LORD, Your compassion and loving devotion,
Remember not the sins of my youth,
Good and upright is the LORD;
He guides the humble in what is right
All the LORD’s ways are loving and faithful
For the sake of Your name, O LORD,
Who is the man who fears the LORD?
His soul will dwell in prosperity,
The LORD confides in those who fear Him,
My eyes are always on the LORD,
Turn to me and be gracious,
The troubles of my heart increase;
Consider my affliction and trouble,
Consider my enemies, for they are many,
Guard my soul and deliver me;
May integrity and uprightness preserve me,
Redeem Israel, O God,
