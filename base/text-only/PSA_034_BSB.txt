Of David, when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech,
My soul boasts in the LORD;
Magnify the LORD with me;
I sought the LORD, and He answered me;
Those who look to Him are radiant with joy;
This poor man called out, and the LORD heard him;
The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him,
Taste and see that the LORD is good;
Fear the LORD, you His saints,
Young lions go lacking and hungry,
Come, children, listen to me;
Who is the man who delights in life,
Keep your tongue from evil
Turn away from evil and do good;
The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous,
But the face of the LORD is against those who do evil,
The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears;
The LORD is near to the brokenhearted;
Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
He protects all his bones;
Evil will slay the wicked,
The LORD redeems His servants,
