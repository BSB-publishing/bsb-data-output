Hallelujah!
I will praise the LORD all my life;
Put not your trust in princes,
When his spirit departs, he returns to the ground;
Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob,
the Maker of heaven and earth,
He executes justice for the oppressed
the LORD opens the eyes of the blind,
The LORD protects foreigners;
The LORD reigns forever,
