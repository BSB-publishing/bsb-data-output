This is the burden against Damascus:
The cities of Aroer are forsaken;
The fortress will disappear from Ephraim,
“In that day the splendor of Jacob will fade,
as the reaper gathers the standing grain
Yet gleanings will remain,
In that day men will look to their Maker
They will not look to the altars
In that day their strong cities
For you have forgotten the God of your salvation
though on the day you plant
Alas, the tumult of many peoples;
The nations rage like the rush of many waters.
In the evening, there is sudden terror!
