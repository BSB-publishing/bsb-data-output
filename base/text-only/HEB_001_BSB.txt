On many past occasions and in many different ways, God spoke to our fathers through the prophets.
But in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son,
The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His nature, upholding all things by His powerful word. After He had provided purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.
So He became as far superior to the angels as the name He has inherited is excellent beyond theirs.
For to which of the angels did God ever say:
And again, when God brings His firstborn into the world, He says:
Now about the angels He says:
But about the Son He says:
You have loved righteousness
And:
They will perish, but You remain;
You will roll them up like a robe;
Yet to which of the angels did God ever say:
Are not the angels
