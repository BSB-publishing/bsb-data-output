Put the ram’s horn to your lips!
Israel cries out to Me,
But Israel has rejected good;
They set up kings, but not by Me.
He has rejected your calf,
For this thing is from Israel—
For they sow the wind,
Israel is swallowed up!
For they have gone up to Assyria
Though they hire allies among the nations,
Though Ephraim multiplied the altars for sin,
Though I wrote for them the great things of My law,
Though they offer sacrifices as gifts to Me,
Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;
