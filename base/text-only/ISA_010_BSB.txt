Woe to those who enact unjust statutes
to deprive the poor of fair treatment
What will you do on the day of reckoning
Nothing will remain but to crouch among the captives
Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger;
I will send him against a godless nation;
But this is not his intention;
“Are not all my commanders kings?” he says.
“Is not Calno like Carchemish?
As my hand seized the idolatrous kingdoms
and as I have done to Samaria and its idols,
So when the Lord has completed all His work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, He will say, “I will punish the king of Assyria for the fruit of his arrogant heart and the proud look in his eyes.
For he says:
My hand reached as into a nest
Does an axe raise itself above the one who swings it?
Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts will send a wasting disease
And the Light of Israel will become a fire,
The splendor of its forests and orchards,
The remaining trees of its forests will be so few
On that day the remnant of Israel
A remnant will return
Though your people, O Israel, be like the sand of the sea,
For the Lord GOD of Hosts will carry out
Therefore this is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says:
For in just a little while
And the LORD of Hosts will brandish a whip against them,
On that day the burden will be lifted from your shoulders,
Assyria has entered Aiath
They have crossed at the ford:
Cry aloud, O Daughter of Gallim!
Madmenah flees;
Yet today they will halt at Nob,
Behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts
He will clear the forest thickets with an axe,
