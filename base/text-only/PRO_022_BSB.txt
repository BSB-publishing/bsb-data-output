A good name is more desirable than great riches;
The rich and the poor have this in common:
The prudent see danger and take cover,
The rewards of humility and the fear of the LORD
Thorns and snares lie on the path of the perverse;
Train up a child in the way he should go,
The rich rule over the poor,
He who sows injustice will reap disaster,
A generous man
Drive out the mocker, and conflict will depart;
He who loves a pure heart and gracious lips
The LORD’s eyes keep watch over knowledge,
The slacker says, “There is a lion outside!
The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit;
Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child,
Oppressing the poor to enrich oneself or giving gifts to the rich
Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise —
for it is pleasing when you keep them within you
So that your trust may be in the LORD,
Have I not written for you thirty sayings
to show you true and reliable words,
Do not rob a poor man because he is poor,
for the LORD will take up their case
Do not make friends with an angry man,
or you may learn his ways
Do not be one who gives pledges,
If you have nothing with which to pay,
Do not move an ancient boundary stone
Do you see a man skilled in his work?
