Give thanks to the LORD, call upon His name;
Sing to Him, sing praises to Him;
Glory in His holy name;
Seek out the LORD and His strength;
Remember the wonders He has done,
O offspring of His servant Abraham,
He is the LORD our God;
He remembers His covenant forever,
the covenant He made with Abraham,
He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
“I will give you the land of Canaan
When they were few in number,
they wandered from nation to nation,
He let no man oppress them;
“Do not touch My anointed ones!
He called down famine on the land
He sent a man before them—
They bruised his feet with shackles
until his prediction came true
The king sent and released him;
He made him master of his household,
to instruct
Then Israel entered Egypt;
And the LORD made His people very fruitful,
whose hearts He turned to hate His people,
He sent Moses His servant,
They performed His miraculous signs among them,
He sent darkness, and it became dark—
He turned their waters to blood
Their land teemed with frogs,
He spoke, and insects swarmed—
He gave them hail for rain,
He struck their vines and fig trees
He spoke, and the locusts came—
They devoured every plant in their land
Then He struck all the firstborn in their land,
He brought Israel out with silver and gold,
Egypt was glad when they departed,
He spread a cloud as a covering
They asked, and He brought quail
He opened a rock, and water gushed out;
For He remembered His holy promise
He brought forth His people with rejoicing,
He gave them the lands of the nations,
that they might keep His statutes
