And Elihu continued:
“Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you
I get my knowledge from afar,
For truly my words are free of falsehood;
Indeed, God is mighty, but He despises no one;
He does not keep the wicked alive,
He does not take His eyes off the righteous,
And if men are bound with chains,
then He tells them their deeds
He opens their ears to correction
If they obey and serve Him,
But if they do not obey,
The godless in heart harbor resentment;
They die in their youth,
God rescues the afflicted by their affliction
Indeed, He drew you from the jaws of distress
But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked;
Be careful that no one lures you with riches;
Can your wealth
Do not long for the night,
Be careful not to turn to iniquity,
Behold, God is exalted in His power.
Who has appointed His way for Him,
Remember to magnify His work,
All mankind has seen it;
Indeed, God is great — beyond our knowledge;
For He draws up drops of water
which the clouds pour out
Furthermore, who can understand how the clouds spread out,
See how He scatters His lightning around Him
For by these He judges
He fills His hands with lightning
The thunder declares His presence;
