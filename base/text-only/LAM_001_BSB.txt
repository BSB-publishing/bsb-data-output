How
She weeps aloud in the night,
Judah has gone into exile
The roads to Zion mourn,
Her foes have become her masters;
All the splendor has departed
In the days of her affliction and wandering
Jerusalem has sinned greatly;
Her uncleanness stains her skirts;
The adversary has seized
All her people groan
Is this nothing to you, all you who pass by?
He sent fire from on high,
My transgressions are bound into a yoke,
The Lord has rejected
For these things I weep;
Zion stretches out her hands,
The LORD is righteous,
I called out to my lovers,
See, O LORD, how distressed I am!
People have heard my groaning,
Let all their wickedness come before You,
