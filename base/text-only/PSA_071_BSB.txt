In You, O LORD, I have taken refuge;
In Your justice, rescue and deliver me;
Be my rock of refuge,
Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked,
For You are my hope, O Lord GOD,
I have leaned on You since birth;
I have become a portent to many,
My mouth is filled with Your praise
Do not discard me in my old age;
For my enemies speak against me,
saying, “God has forsaken him;
Be not far from me, O God.
May the accusers of my soul
But I will always hope
My mouth will declare Your righteousness
I will come in the strength of the Lord GOD;
O God, You have taught me from my youth,
Even when I am old and gray,
Your righteousness reaches to the heavens, O God,
Though You have shown me many troubles and misfortunes,
You will increase my honor
So I will praise You with the harp
When I sing praise to You
My tongue will indeed proclaim
