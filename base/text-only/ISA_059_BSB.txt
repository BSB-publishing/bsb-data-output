Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save,
But your iniquities have built barriers
For your hands are stained with blood,
No one calls for justice;
They hatch the eggs of vipers
Their cobwebs cannot be made into clothing,
Their feet run to evil;
The way of peace they have not known,
Therefore justice is far from us,
Like the blind, we feel our way along the wall,
We all growl like bears
For our transgressions are multiplied before You,
rebelling and denying the LORD,
So justice is turned away,
Truth is missing,
He saw that there was no man;
He put on righteousness like a breastplate,
So He will repay according to their deeds:
So shall they fear the name of the LORD
“The Redeemer will come to Zion,
“As for Me, this is My covenant with them,”
