For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.
In the day of trouble I sought the Lord;
I remembered You, O God, and I groaned;
You have kept my eyes from closing;
I considered the days of old,
At night I remembered my song;
“Will the Lord spurn us forever
Is His loving devotion gone forever?
Has God forgotten to be gracious?
So I said, “I am grieved
I will remember the works of the LORD;
I will reflect on all You have done
Your way, O God, is holy.
You are the God who works wonders;
With power You redeemed Your people,
The waters saw You, O God;
The clouds poured down water;
Your thunder resounded in the whirlwind;
Your path led through the sea,
You led Your people like a flock
