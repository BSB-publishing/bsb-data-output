For the choirmaster. According to Gittith.
My soul longs, even faints,
Even the sparrow has found a home,
How blessed are those who dwell in Your house!
Blessed are those whose strength is in You,
As they pass through the Valley of Baca,
They go from strength to strength,
O LORD God of Hosts, hear my prayer;
Take notice of our shield, O God,
For better is one day in Your courts
For the LORD God is a sun and a shield;
O LORD of Hosts,
