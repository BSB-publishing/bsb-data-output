Do not envy wicked men
for their hearts devise violence,
By wisdom a house is built
through knowledge its rooms are filled
A wise man is strong,
Only with sound guidance should you wage war,
Wisdom is too high for a fool;
He who plots evil
A foolish scheme is sin,
If you faint in the day of distress,
Rescue those being led away to death,
If you say, “Behold, we did not know about this,”
Eat honey, my son, for it is good,
Know therefore that wisdom is sweet to your soul.
Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, near the dwelling of the righteous;
For though a righteous man may fall seven times, he still gets up;
Do not gloat when your enemy falls,
or the LORD will see and disapprove,
Do not fret over evildoers,
For the evil man has no future;
My son, fear the LORD and the king,
For they will bring sudden destruction.
These also are sayings of the wise:
Whoever tells the guilty, “You are innocent”—
but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,
An honest answer given
Complete your outdoor work and prepare your field;
Do not testify against your neighbor without cause,
Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;
I went past the field of a slacker
Thorns had grown up everywhere,
I observed and took it to heart;
A little sleep, a little slumber,
and poverty will come upon you like a robber,
