This is the burden against Nineveh, the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:
The LORD is a jealous and avenging God;
The LORD is slow to anger
He rebukes the sea and dries it up;
The mountains quake before Him,
Who can withstand His indignation?
The LORD is good,
But with an overwhelming flood
Whatever you plot against the LORD,
For they will be entangled as with thorns
From you, O Nineveh, comes forth
This is what the LORD says:
For I will now break their yoke from your neck
The LORD has issued a command concerning you, O Nineveh:
Look to the mountains—
