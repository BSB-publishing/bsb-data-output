Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those in distress. In the past He humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future He will honor the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations:
The people walking in darkness
You have enlarged the nation
For as in the day of Midian
For every trampling boot of battle
For unto us a child is born,
Of the increase of His government and peace
The Lord has sent a message against Jacob,
All the people will know it —
“The bricks have fallen,
The LORD has raised up the foes of Rezin against him
Aram
But the people did not return to Him who struck them;
So the LORD will cut off Israel’s head and tail,
The head is the elder and honorable man,
For those who guide this people mislead them,
Therefore the Lord takes no pleasure in their young men;
For wickedness burns like a fire
By the wrath of the LORD of Hosts
They carve out what is on the right,
Manasseh devours Ephraim,
