So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
This kindled the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram. He burned with anger against Job for justifying himself rather than God,
and he burned with anger against Job’s three friends because they had failed to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.
Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he.
But when he saw that the three men had no further reply, his anger was kindled.
So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite declared:
I thought that age should speak,
But there is a spirit
It is not only the old
Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me;
Indeed, I waited while you spoke;
I paid you full attention.
So do not claim, ‘We have found wisdom;
But Job has not directed his words against me,
Job’s friends are dismayed, with no more to say;
Must I wait, now that they are silent,
I too will answer;
For I am full of words,
Behold, my belly is like unvented wine;
I must speak and find relief;
I will be partial to no one,
For I do not know how to flatter,
