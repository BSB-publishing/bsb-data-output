“At that time,” declares the LORD, “the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of the officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the people of Jerusalem will be removed from their graves.
They will be exposed to the sun and moon, and to all the host of heaven which they have loved, served, followed, consulted, and worshiped. Their bones will not be gathered up or buried, but will become like dung lying on the ground.
And wherever I have banished them, the remnant of this evil family will choose death over life,” declares the LORD of Hosts.
So you are to tell them this is what the LORD says:
Why then have these people turned away?
I have listened and heard;
Even the stork in the sky
How can you say, ‘We are wise,
The wise will be put to shame;
Therefore I will give their wives to other men
They dress the wound of the daughter of My people
Are they ashamed of the abomination they have committed?
I will take away their harvest,
Why are we just sitting here?
We hoped for peace,
The snorting of enemy horses
“For behold, I will send snakes among you,
My sorrow is beyond healing;
Listen to the cry of the daughter of my people
“The harvest has passed, the summer has ended,
For the brokenness of the daughter of my people I am crushed.
Is there no balm in Gilead?
