Then Job answered:
“Yes, I know that it is so,
If one wished to contend with God,
God is wise in heart and mighty in strength.
He moves mountains without their knowledge
He shakes the earth from its place,
He commands the sun not to shine;
He alone stretches out the heavens
He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion,
He does great things beyond searching out,
Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him;
If He takes away,
God does not restrain His anger;
How then can I answer Him
For even if I were right, I could not answer.
If I summoned Him and He answered me,
For He would crush me with a tempest
He does not let me catch my breath,
If it is a matter of strength,
Even if I were righteous, my mouth would condemn me;
Though I am blameless, I have no concern for myself;
It is all the same, and so I say,
When the scourge brings sudden death,
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;
My days are swifter than a runner;
They sweep by like boats of papyrus,
If I were to say, ‘I will forget my complaint
I would still dread all my sufferings;
Since I am already found guilty,
If I should wash myself with snow
then You would plunge me into the pit,
For He is not a man like me, that I can answer Him,
Nor is there a mediator between us,
Let Him remove His rod from me,
Then I would speak without fear of Him.
