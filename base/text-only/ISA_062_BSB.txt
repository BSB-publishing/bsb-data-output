For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent,
Nations will see your righteousness,
You will be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD,
No longer will you be called Forsaken,
For as a young man marries a young woman,
On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have posted watchmen;
nor give Him any rest
The LORD has sworn by His right hand
For those who harvest grain
Go out, go out through the gates;
Behold, the LORD has proclaimed
And they will be called the Holy People,
