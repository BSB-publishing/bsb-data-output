“Call out if you please, but who will answer?
For resentment kills a fool,
I have seen a fool taking root,
His sons are far from safety,
The hungry consume his harvest,
For distress does not spring from the dust,
Yet man is born to trouble
However, if I were you, I would appeal to God
the One who does great and unsearchable things,
He gives rain to the earth
He sets the lowly on high,
He thwarts the schemes of the crafty,
He catches the wise in their craftiness,
They encounter darkness by day
He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth
So the poor have hope,
Blessed indeed is the man whom God corrects;
For He wounds, but He also binds;
He will rescue you from six calamities;
In famine He will redeem you from death,
You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,
You will laugh at destruction and famine,
For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field,
You will know that your tent is secure,
You will know that your offspring will be many,
You will come to the grave in full vigor,
Indeed, we have investigated, and it is true!
