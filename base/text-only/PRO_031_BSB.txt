These are the words of King Lemuel — the burden that his mother taught him:
What shall I say,
Do not spend your strength on women
It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
lest they drink and forget what is decreed,
Give strong drink to one who is perishing,
Let him drink and forget his poverty,
Open your mouth for those with no voice,
Open your mouth, judge righteously,
A wife
The heart of her husband trusts in her,
She brings him good and not harm
She selects wool and flax
She is like the merchant ships,
She rises while it is still night
She appraises a field and buys it;
She girds herself
She sees that her gain is good,
She stretches out her hands to the distaff
She opens her arms to the poor
When it snows, she has no fear for her household,
She makes coverings for her bed;
Her husband is known at the city gates,
She makes linen garments and sells them;
Strength and honor are her clothing,
She opens her mouth with wisdom,
She watches over the affairs of her household
Her children rise up and call her blessed;
“Many daughters have done noble things,
Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting,
Give her the fruit of her hands,
