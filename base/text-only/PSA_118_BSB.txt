Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good;
Let Israel
Let the house of Aaron say,
Let those who fear the LORD say,
In my distress I called to the LORD,
The LORD is on my side;
The LORD is on my side; He is my helper.
It is better to take refuge in the LORD
It is better to take refuge in the LORD
All the nations surrounded me,
They surrounded me on every side,
They swarmed around me like bees,
I was pushed so hard I was falling,
The LORD is my strength and my song,
Shouts of joy and salvation resound in the tents of the righteous:
The right hand of the LORD is exalted!
I will not die, but I will live
The LORD disciplined me severely,
Open to me the gates of righteousness,
This is the gate of the LORD;
I will give You thanks, for You have answered me,
The stone the builders rejected
This is from the LORD,
This is the day that the LORD has made;
O LORD, save us, we pray.
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD.
The LORD is God;
You are my God, and I will give You thanks.
Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good;
