Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
“Should this stream of words go unanswered
Should your babbling put others to silence?
You have said, ‘My doctrine is sound,
But if only God would speak
and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom,
Can you fathom the deep things of God
They are higher than the heavens— what can you do?
Their measure is longer than the earth
If He comes along to imprison you,
Surely He knows the deceit of men.
But a witless man can no more become wise
As for you, if you direct your heart
if you put away the iniquity in your hand,
then indeed you will lift up your face without blemish;
For you will forget your misery,
Your life will be brighter than noonday;
You will be secure, because there is hope,
You will lie down without fear,
But the eyes of the wicked will fail,
