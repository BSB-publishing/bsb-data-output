On my bed at night
I will arise now and go about the city,
I encountered the watchmen on their rounds of the city:
I had just passed them when I found the one I love.
O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you
Who is this coming up from the wilderness
Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage,
All are skilled with the sword,
King Solomon has made his carriage
He has made its posts of silver,
Come out, O daughters of Zion,
