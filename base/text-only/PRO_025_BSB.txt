These are additional proverbs of Solomon, which were copied by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:
It is the glory of God to conceal a matter
As the heavens are high and the earth is deep,
Remove the dross from the silver,
Remove the wicked from the king’s presence,
Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king,
for it is better to be told, “Come up here!”
do not bring hastily to court.
Argue your case with your neighbor
lest he who hears you bring shame upon you,
A word fitly spoken
Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold
Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest
Like clouds and wind without rain
Through patience a ruler can be persuaded,
If you find honey, eat just what you need,
Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house,
Like a club or sword or sharp arrow
Like a broken tooth or a foot out of joint
Like one who removes a garment on a cold day
If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat,
For in so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head,
As the north wind brings forth rain,
Better to live on a corner of the roof
Like cold water to a weary soul
Like a muddied spring or a polluted well
It is not good to eat too much honey
Like a city whose walls are broken down
