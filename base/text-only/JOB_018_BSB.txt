Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
“How long until you end these speeches?
Why are we regarded as cattle,
You who tear yourself in anger—
Indeed, the lamp of the wicked is extinguished;
The light in his tent grows dark,
His vigorous stride is shortened,
For his own feet lead him into a net,
A trap seizes his heel;
A noose is hidden in the ground,
Terrors frighten him on every side
His strength is depleted,
It devours patches of his skin;
He is torn from the shelter of his tent
Fire resides in his tent;
The roots beneath him dry up,
The memory of him perishes from the earth,
He is driven from light into darkness
He has no offspring or posterity among his people,
Those in the west are appalled at his fate,
Surely such is the dwelling of the wicked
