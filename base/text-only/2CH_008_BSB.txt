Now at the end of the twenty years during which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own palace,
Solomon rebuilt the cities Hiram
Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and captured it.
He built Tadmor in the wilderness, in addition to all the store cities that he had built in Hamath.
He rebuilt Upper and Lower Beth-horon as fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,
as well as Baalath, all the store cities that belonged to Solomon, and all the cities for his chariots and horses
As for all the people who remained of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (these people were not Israelites) —
their descendants who remained in the land, those whom the Israelites had not destroyed — Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers, as they are to this day.

Thus all the work of Solomon was carried out, from the day the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed.
Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth
