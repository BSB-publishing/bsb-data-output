A prayer of one who is afflicted, when he grows faint and pours out his lament before the LORD.
Do not hide Your face from me
For my days vanish like smoke,
My heart is afflicted, and withered like grass;
Through my loud groaning
I am like a desert owl,
I lie awake;
All day long my enemies taunt me;
For I have eaten ashes like bread
because of Your indignation and wrath,
My days are like lengthening shadows,
But You, O LORD, sit enthroned forever;
You will rise up and have compassion on Zion,
For Your servants delight in her stones
So the nations will fear the name of the LORD,
For the LORD will rebuild Zion;
He will turn toward the prayer of the destitute;
Let this be written for the generation to come,
For He looked down from the heights of His sanctuary;
to hear a prisoner’s groaning,
that they may proclaim the name of the LORD in Zion
when peoples and kingdoms assemble
He has broken my strength on the way;
I say: “O my God, do not take me in the midst of my days!
In the beginning You laid the foundations of the earth,
They will perish, but You remain;
But You remain the same,
The children of Your servants will dwell securely,
