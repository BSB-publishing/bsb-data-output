A Maskil
I will open my mouth in parables;
that we have heard and known
We will not hide them from their children
For He established a testimony in Jacob
that the coming generation would know them—
that they should put their confidence in God,
Then they will not be like their fathers,
The archers of Ephraim
They failed to keep God’s covenant
They forgot what He had done,
He worked wonders before their fathers
He split the sea and brought them through;
He led them with a cloud by day
He split the rocks in the wilderness
He brought streams from the stone
But they continued to sin against Him,
They willfully tested God
They spoke against God, saying,
When He struck the rock, water gushed out
Therefore the LORD heard
because they did not believe God
Yet He commanded the clouds above
He rained down manna for them to eat;
Man ate the bread of angels;
He stirred the east wind from the heavens
He rained meat on them like dust,
He felled them in the midst of their camp,
So they ate and were well filled,
Yet before they had filled their desire,
God’s anger flared against them,
In spite of all this, they kept on sinning;
So He ended their days in futility,
When He slew them, they would seek Him;
And they remembered that God was their Rock,
But they deceived Him with their mouths,
Their hearts were disloyal to Him,
And yet He was compassionate;
He remembered that they were but flesh,
How often they disobeyed Him in the wilderness
Again and again they tested God
They did not remember His power
when He performed His signs in Egypt
He turned their rivers to blood,
He sent swarms of flies that devoured them,
He gave their crops to the grasshopper,
He killed their vines with hailstones
He abandoned their cattle to the hail
He unleashed His fury against them,
He cleared a path for His anger;
He struck all the firstborn of Egypt,
He led out His people like sheep
He led them safely, so they did not fear,
He brought them to His holy land,
He drove out nations before them
But they tested and disobeyed God Most High,
They turned back and were faithless like their fathers,
They enraged Him with their high places
On hearing it, God was furious
He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh,
He delivered His strength to captivity,
He surrendered His people to the sword
Fire consumed His young men,
His priests fell by the sword,
Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,
He beat back His foes;
He rejected the tent of Joseph
But He chose the tribe of Judah,
He built His sanctuary like the heights,
He chose David His servant
from tending the ewes He brought him
So David shepherded them with integrity of heart
