Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
“Who is this who obscures My counsel
Now brace yourself
Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?
Who fixed its measurements? Surely you know!
On what were its foundations set,
while the morning stars sang together
Who enclosed the sea behind doors
when I made the clouds its garment
when I fixed its boundaries
and I declared: ‘You may come this far, but no farther;
In your days, have you commanded the morning
that it might spread to the ends of the earth
The earth takes shape like clay under a seal;
Light is withheld from the wicked,
Have you journeyed to the vents of the sea
Have the gates of death been revealed to you?
Have you surveyed the extent of the earth?
Where is the way to the home of light?
so you can lead it back to its border?
Surely you know, for you were already born!
Have you entered the storehouses of snow
which I hold in reserve for times of trouble,
In which direction is the lightning dispersed,
Who cuts a channel for the flood
to bring rain on a barren land,
to satisfy the parched wasteland
Does the rain have a father?
From whose womb does the ice emerge?
when the waters become hard as stone
Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades
Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons
Do you know the laws of the heavens?
Can you command the clouds
Can you send the lightning bolts on their way?
Who has put wisdom in the heart
Who has the wisdom to count the clouds?
when the dust hardens into a mass
Can you hunt the prey for a lioness
when they crouch in their dens
Who provides food for the raven
