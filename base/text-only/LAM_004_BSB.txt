How
How the precious sons of Zion,
Even jackals
The nursing infant’s tongue
Those who once ate delicacies
The punishment
Her dignitaries were brighter than snow,
But now their appearance is blacker than soot;
Those slain by the sword are better off
The hands of compassionate women
The LORD has exhausted His wrath;
The kings of the earth did not believe,
But this was for the sins of her prophets
They wandered blind in the streets,
“Go away! Unclean!”
The presence of the LORD has scattered them;
All the while our eyes were failing
They stalked our every step,
Those who chased us were swifter
The LORD’s anointed, the breath of our life,
So rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of Edom,
O Daughter of Zion, your punishment is complete;
