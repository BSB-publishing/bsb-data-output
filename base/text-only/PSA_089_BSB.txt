A Maskil
For I have said, “Loving devotion is built up forever;
You said, “I have made a covenant with My chosen one,
‘I will establish your offspring forever
The heavens praise Your wonders, O LORD —
For who in the skies can compare with the LORD?
In the council of the holy ones, God is greatly feared,
O LORD God of Hosts, who is like You?
You rule the raging sea;
You crushed Rahab like a carcass;
The heavens are Yours, and also the earth.
North and south You created;
Mighty is Your arm; strong is Your hand.
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne;
Blessed are those who know the joyful sound,
They rejoice in Your name all day long,
For You are the glory of their strength,
Surely our shield belongs to the LORD,
You once spoke in a vision;
I have found My servant David;
My hand will sustain him;
No enemy will exact tribute;
I will crush his foes before him
My faithfulness and loving devotion will be with him,
I will set his hand over the sea,
He will call to Me, ‘You are my Father,
I will indeed appoint him as My firstborn,
I will forever preserve My loving devotion for him,
I will establish his line forever,
If his sons forsake My law
if they violate My statutes
I will attend to their transgression with the rod,
But I will not withdraw My loving devotion from him,
I will not violate My covenant
Once and for all I have sworn by My holiness —
his offspring shall endure forever,
like the moon, established forever,
Now, however, You have spurned and rejected him;
You have renounced the covenant with Your servant
You have broken down all his walls;
All who pass by plunder him;
You have exalted the right hand of his foes;
You have bent the edge of his sword
You have ended his splendor
You have cut short the days of his youth;
How long, O LORD?
Remember the briefness of my lifespan!
What man can live and never see death?
Where, O Lord, is Your loving devotion of old,
Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants,
how Your enemies have taunted, O LORD,
Blessed be the LORD forever!
