“Why does the Almighty not reserve times for judgment?
Men move boundary stones;
They drive away the donkey of the fatherless
They push the needy off the road
Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert,
They gather fodder in the fields
Without clothing, they spend the night naked;
Drenched by mountain rains,
The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast;
Without clothing, they wander about naked.
They crush olives within their walls;
From the city, men groan,
Then there are those who rebel against the light,
When daylight is gone, the murderer rises
The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight.
In the dark they dig through houses;
For to them, deep darkness is their morning;
They are but foam on the surface of the water;
As drought and heat consume the melting snow,
The womb forgets them;
They prey on the barren and childless,
Yet by His power, God drags away the mighty;
He gives them a sense of security,
They are exalted for a moment,
If this is not so, then who can prove me a liar
