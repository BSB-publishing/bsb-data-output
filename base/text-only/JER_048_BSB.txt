Concerning Moab, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
There is no longer praise for Moab;
A voice cries out from Horonaim:
Moab will be shattered;
For on the ascent to Luhith
‘Flee! Run for your lives!
Because you trust in your works and treasures,
The destroyer will move against every city,
Put salt on Moab,
Cursed is the one who is remiss
Moab has been at ease from youth,
Therefore behold, the days are coming,
Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,
How can you say, ‘We are warriors,
Moab has been destroyed
Moab’s calamity is at hand,
Mourn for him, all you who surround him,
Come down from your glory; sit on parched ground,
Stand by the road and watch,
Moab is put to shame, for it has been shattered.
Judgment has come upon the high plain—
upon Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim,
upon Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon,
upon Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the towns of Moab,
The horn of Moab has been cut off,
“Make him drunk,
Was not Israel your object of ridicule?
Abandon the towns and settle among the rocks,
We have heard of Moab’s pomposity,
I know his insolence,”
Therefore I will wail for Moab;
I will weep for you, O vine of Sibmah,
Joy and gladness are removed from the orchard
There is a cry from Heshbon to Elealeh;
In Moab, declares the LORD,
Therefore My heart laments like a flute for Moab;
For every head is shaved
On all the rooftops of Moab
“How shattered it is! How they wail!
For this is what the LORD says:
Kirioth has been taken,
Moab will be destroyed as a nation
Terror and pit and snare await you, O dweller of Moab,”
“Whoever flees the panic
“Those who flee will stand helpless in Heshbon’s shadow,
Woe to you, O Moab!
Yet in the latter days I will restore Moab from captivity,
