Then Job answered:
“Listen carefully to my words;
Bear with me while I speak;
Is my complaint against a man?
Look at me and be appalled;
When I remember, terror takes hold,
Why do the wicked live on,
Their descendants are established around them,
Their homes are safe from fear;
Their bulls breed without fail;
They send forth their little ones like a flock;
singing to the tambourine and lyre
They spend their days in prosperity
Yet they say to God: ‘Leave us alone!
Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him,
Still, their prosperity is not in their own hands,
How often is the lamp of the wicked put out?
Are they like straw before the wind,
It is said that God lays up one’s punishment for his children.
Let his eyes see his own destruction;
For what does he care about his household after him,
Can anyone teach knowledge to God,
One man dies full of vigor,
His body is well nourished,
Yet another man dies in the bitterness of his soul,
But together they lie down in the dust,
Behold, I know your thoughts full well,
For you say, ‘Where now is the nobleman’s house,
Have you never asked those who travel the roads?
Indeed, the evil man is spared from the day of calamity,
Who denounces his behavior to his face?
He is carried to the grave,
The clods of the valley are sweet to him;
So how can you comfort me with empty words?
