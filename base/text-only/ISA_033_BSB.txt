Woe to you, O destroyer never destroyed,
O LORD, be gracious to us!
The peoples flee the thunder of Your voice;
Your spoil, O nations,
The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high;
He will be the sure foundation for your times,
Behold, their valiant ones cry aloud in the streets;
The highways are deserted;
The land mourns and languishes;
“Now I will arise,” says the LORD.
You conceive chaff; you give birth to stubble.
The peoples will be burned to ashes,
You who are far off, hear what I have done;
The sinners in Zion are afraid;
He who walks righteously
he will dwell on the heights;
Your eyes will see the King in His beauty
Your mind will ponder the former terror:
You will no longer see the insolent,
Look upon Zion,
But there the Majestic One, our LORD,
For the LORD is our Judge,
Your ropes are slack;
And no resident of Zion will say, “I am sick.”
