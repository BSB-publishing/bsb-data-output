In the second year of the reign of Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak,
that this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
Then the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet, saying:
“Is it a time for you yourselves
Now this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
You have planted much
This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
Go up into the hills,
You expected much,
Therefore, on account of you
I have summoned a drought
Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, as well as all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of the prophet Haggai, because the LORD their God had sent him. So the people feared the LORD.
Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, delivered the message of the LORD to the people:
So the LORD stirred the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, as well as the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and began the work on the house of the LORD of Hosts, their God,
on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius.
