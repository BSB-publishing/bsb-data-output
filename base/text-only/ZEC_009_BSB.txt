This is the burden of the word of the LORD
and also against Hamath,
Tyre has built herself a fortress;
Behold, the Lord will impoverish her
Ashkelon will see and fear;
A mixed race will occupy Ashdod,
I will remove the blood from their mouths
But I will camp around My house because of an army,
Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion!
And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim
As for you,
Return to your stronghold,
For I will bend Judah as My bow
Then the LORD will appear over them,
The LORD of Hosts will shield them.
On that day the LORD their God will save them
How lovely they will be,
