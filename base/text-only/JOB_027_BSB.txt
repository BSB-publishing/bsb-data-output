Job continued his discourse:
“As surely as God lives, who has deprived me of justice —
as long as my breath is still within me
my lips will not speak wickedness,
I will never say that you are right;
I will cling to my righteousness and never let go.
May my enemy be like the wicked
For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off,
Will God hear his cry
Will he delight in the Almighty?
I will instruct you in the power of God.
Surely all of you have seen it for yourselves.
This is the wicked man’s portion from God —
Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword;
His survivors will be buried by the plague,
Though he heaps up silver like dust
what he lays up, the righteous will wear,
The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon,
He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more;
Terrors overtake him like a flood;
The east wind carries him away, and he is gone;
It hurls itself against him without mercy
It claps its hands at him
