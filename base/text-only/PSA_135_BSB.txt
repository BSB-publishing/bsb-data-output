Hallelujah!
who stand in the house of the LORD,
Hallelujah, for the LORD is good;
For the LORD has chosen Jacob as His own,
For I know that the LORD is great;
The LORD does all that pleases Him
He causes the clouds to rise
He struck down the firstborn of Egypt,
He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt,
He struck down many nations
Sihon king of the Amorites,
He gave their land as an inheritance,
Your name, O LORD, endures forever,
For the LORD will vindicate His people
The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
They have mouths, but cannot speak;
they have ears, but cannot hear;
Those who make them become like them,
O house of Israel, bless the LORD;
O house of Levi, bless the LORD;
Blessed be the LORD from Zion —
