Then Jacob called for his sons and said, “Gather around so that I can tell you what will happen to you in the days to come:
Come together and listen, O sons of Jacob;
Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might,
Uncontrolled as the waters,
Simeon and Levi are brothers;
May I never enter their council;
Cursed be their anger, for it is strong,
Judah,
Judah is a young lion—
The scepter will not depart from Judah,
He ties his donkey to the vine,
His eyes are darker than wine,
Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore
Issachar is a strong donkey,
He saw that his resting place was good
Dan shall provide justice for his people
He will be a snake by the road,
I await Your salvation, O LORD.
Gad
Asher’s food will be rich;
Naphtali is a doe set free
Joseph is a fruitful vine—
The archers attacked him with bitterness;
Yet he steadied his bow,
by the God of your father who helps you,
The blessings of your father have surpassed
Benjamin is a ravenous wolf;
These are the tribes of Israel, twelve in all, and this was what their father said to them. He blessed them, and he blessed each one with a suitable blessing.
Then Jacob instructed them, “I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite.
The cave is in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, in the land of Canaan. This is the field Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site.
There Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah are buried, and there I buried Leah.
The field and the cave that is in it were purchased from the Hittites.”
When Jacob had finished instructing his sons, he pulled his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and he was gathered to his people.
