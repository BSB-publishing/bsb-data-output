Do not boast about tomorrow,
Let another praise you, and not your own mouth—
A stone is heavy and sand is a burden,
Wrath is cruel and anger is like a flood,
Better an open rebuke
The wounds of a friend are faithful,
The soul that is full loathes honey,
Like a bird that strays from its nest
Oil and incense bring joy to the heart,
Do not forsake your friend or your father’s friend,
Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart,
The prudent see danger and take cover,
Take the garment of him who posts security for a stranger;
If one blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,
A constant dripping on a rainy day
restraining her is like holding back the wind
As iron sharpens iron,
Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,
As water reflects the face,
Sheol and Abaddon
A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold,
Though you grind a fool like grain with mortar and a pestle,
Be sure to know the state of your flocks,
for riches are not forever,
When hay is removed and new growth appears
the lambs will provide you with clothing,
You will have plenty of goats’ milk to feed you—
