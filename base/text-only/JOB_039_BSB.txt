“Do you know when mountain goats give birth?
Can you count the months they are pregnant?
They crouch down and bring forth their young;
Their young ones thrive and grow up in the open field;
Who set the wild donkey free?
I made the wilderness his home
He scorns the tumult of the city
He roams the mountains for pasture,
Will the wild ox consent to serve you?
Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness?
Can you rely on his great strength?
Can you trust him to bring in your grain
The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully,
For she leaves her eggs on the ground
She forgets that a foot may crush them,
She treats her young harshly, as if not her own,
For God has deprived her of wisdom;
Yet when she proudly spreads her wings,
Do you give strength to the horse
Do you make him leap like a locust,
He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength;
He laughs at fear, frightened of nothing;
A quiver rattles at his side,
Trembling with excitement, he devours the distance;
At the blast of the horn, he snorts with fervor.
Does the hawk take flight by your understanding
Does the eagle soar at your command
He dwells on a cliff and lodges there;
From there he spies out food;
His young ones feast on blood;
