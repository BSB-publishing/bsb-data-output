On the first day of the week,
They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
While they were puzzling over this, suddenly two men in radiant apparel stood beside them.
As the women bowed their faces to the ground in terror, the two men asked them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?
He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee:
‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’
Then they remembered His words.
And when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.
It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles.
But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women.
Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths, he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.
That same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles
They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
And as they talked and deliberated, Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them.
But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.
He asked them,
One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are You the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in recent days?”
“What things?”
Our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death, and they crucified Him.
But we were hoping He was the One who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things took place.
Furthermore, some of our women astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning,
but they did not find His body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive.
Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described. But Him they did not see.”
Then Jesus said to them,
Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then to enter His glory?”
And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what  was written in all the Scriptures about Himself.
As they approached the village where they were headed, He seemed to be going farther.
But they pleaded with Him, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.”
While He was reclining at the table with them, He took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to them.
Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus — and He disappeared from their sight.
They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us as He spoke with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”
And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem.
and saying, “The Lord has indeed risen and has appeared to Simon!”
Then the two told what had happened on the road, and how they had recognized Jesus in the breaking of the bread.
While they were describing these events, Jesus Himself stood among them and said,
But they were startled and frightened, thinking they had seen a spirit.
“Why are you troubled,”
Look at My hands and My feet. It is I Myself. Touch Me and see — for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”
And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet.
While they were still in disbelief because of their joy and amazement, He asked them,
So they gave Him a piece of broiled fish,
and He took it and ate it in front of them.
Jesus said to them,
Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.
And He told them,
and in His name repentance and
You are witnesses of these things.
When Jesus had led them out as far as Bethany, He lifted up His hands and blessed them.
While He was blessing them, He left them and was carried up into heaven.
And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
praising God continually in the temple.
