Then a shoot will spring up from the stump of Jesse,
The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him—
And He will delight in the fear of the LORD.
but with righteousness He will judge the poor,
Righteousness will be the belt around His hips,
The wolf will live with the lamb,
The cow will graze with the bear,
The infant will play by the cobra’s den,
They will neither harm nor destroy
On that day the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples. The nations will seek Him,
On that day the Lord will extend His hand a second time to recover the remnant of His people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush,
He will raise a banner for the nations
Then the jealousy of Ephraim
They will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines to the west;
The LORD will devote to destruction
There will be a highway for the remnant of His people
