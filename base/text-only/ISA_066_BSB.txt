This is what the LORD says:
Has not My hand made all these things?
Whoever slaughters an ox is like one who slays a man;
So I will choose their punishment
You who tremble at His word,
Hear the uproar from the city;
“Before she was in labor, she gave birth;
Who has heard of such as this?
Shall I bring a baby to the point of birth and not deliver it?”
Be glad for Jerusalem and rejoice over her,
so that you may nurse and be satisfied
For this is what the LORD says:
As a mother comforts her son,
When you see, you will rejoice,
For behold, the LORD will come with fire—
For by fire and by His sword,
“Those who consecrate and purify themselves to enter the groves — to follow one in the center of those who eat the flesh of swine and vermin and rats — will perish together,” declares the LORD.
“And I, knowing their deeds and thoughts, am coming
I will establish a sign among them, and I will send survivors from among them to the nations — to Tarshish, Put, and the archers of Lud; to Tubal, Javan, and the islands
And they will bring all your brothers from all the nations as a gift to the LORD on horses and chariots and wagons, on mules and camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem,” says the LORD, “just as the Israelites bring an offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.”
“And I will select some of them as priests and Levites,” says the LORD.
“For just as the new heavens and the new earth,
From one New Moon to another
“As they go forth, they will see the corpses
