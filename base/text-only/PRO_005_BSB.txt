My son, pay attention to my wisdom;
that you may maintain discretion
Though the lips of the forbidden woman
in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
Her feet go down to death;
She does not consider the path of life;
So now, my sons, listen to me,
Keep your path far from her;
lest you concede your vigor to others,
lest strangers feast on your wealth,
At the end of your life you will groan
and you will say, “How I hated discipline,
I did not listen to the voice of my teachers
I am on the brink of utter ruin
Drink water from your own cistern,
Why should your springs flow in the streets,
Let them be yours alone,
May your fountain be blessed,
A loving doe, a graceful fawn—
Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress,
For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the LORD,
The iniquities of a wicked man entrap him;
He dies for lack of discipline,
