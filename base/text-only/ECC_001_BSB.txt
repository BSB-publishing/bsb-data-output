These are the words of the Teacher,
“Futility
What does a man gain from all his labor,
Generations come and generations go,
The sun rises and the sun sets;
The wind blows southward,
All the rivers flow into the sea,
All things are wearisome,
What has been will be again,
Is there a case where one can say,
There is no remembrance
I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a miserable task God has laid upon the sons of men to occupy them!
I have seen all the things that are done under the sun, and have found them all to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.
What is crooked cannot be straightened,
I said to myself, “Behold, I have grown and increased in wisdom beyond all those before me who were over Jerusalem, and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.”
So I set my mind to know wisdom and madness and folly; I learned that this, too, is a pursuit of the wind.
For with much wisdom comes much sorrow,
