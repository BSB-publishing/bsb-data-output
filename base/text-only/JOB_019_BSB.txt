Then Job answered:
“How long will you torment me
Ten times now you have reproached me;
Even if I have truly gone astray,
If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me
then understand that it is God who has wronged me
Though I cry out, ‘Violence!’ I get no response;
He has blocked my way so I cannot pass;
He has stripped me of my honor
He tears me down on every side until I am gone;
His anger burns against me,
His troops advance together;
He has removed my brothers from me;
My kinsmen have failed me,
My guests and maidservants count me as a stranger;
I call for my servant, but he does not answer,
My breath is repulsive to my wife,
Even little boys scorn me;
All my best friends despise me,
My skin and flesh cling to my bones;
Have pity on me, my friends, have pity,
Why do you persecute me as God does?
I wish that my words were recorded
by an iron stylus on lead,
But I know that my Redeemer
Even after my skin has been destroyed,
I will see Him for myself;
If you say, ‘Let us persecute him,
then you should fear the sword yourselves,
