Of David. A Maskil.
Blessed is the man
When I kept silent, my bones became brittle
For day and night
Then I acknowledged my sin to You
Therefore let all the godly pray to You
You are my hiding place.
I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go;
Do not be like the horse or mule,
Many are the sorrows of the wicked,
Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, O righteous ones;
