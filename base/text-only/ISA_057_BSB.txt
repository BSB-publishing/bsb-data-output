The righteous perish,
Those who walk uprightly enter into peace;
“But come here, you sons of a sorceress,
Whom are you mocking?
who burn with lust among the oaks,
Your portion is among the smooth stones of the valley;
On a high and lofty hill you have made your bed,
Behind the door and doorpost
You went to Molech
You are wearied by your many journeys,
Whom have you dreaded and feared,
I will expose your righteousness and your works,
When you cry out,
And it will be said,
For thus says the One who is high and lifted up,
For I will not accuse you forever,
I was enraged by his sinful greed,
I have seen his ways,
bringing praise to their lips.
But the wicked are like the storm-tossed sea,
“There is no peace,” says my God,
