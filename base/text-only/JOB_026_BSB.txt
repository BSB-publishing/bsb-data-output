Then Job answered:
“How you have helped the powerless
How you have counseled the unwise
To whom have you uttered these words?
The dead tremble —
Sheol is naked before God,
He stretches out the north over empty space;
He wraps up the waters in His clouds,
He covers the face of the full moon,
He has inscribed a horizon on the face of the waters
The foundations of heaven quake,
By His power He stirred
By His breath the skies were cleared;
Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways;
