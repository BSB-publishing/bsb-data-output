My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor,
if you have been trapped by the words of your lips,
then do this, my son, to free yourself,
Allow no sleep to your eyes
Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
Walk in the manner of the ant, O slacker;
Without a commander,
it prepares its provisions in summer;
How long will you lie there, O slacker?
A little sleep, a little slumber,
and poverty will come upon you like a robber,
A worthless person, a wicked man,
winking his eyes, speaking with his feet,
With deceit in his heart he devises evil;
Therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly;
There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to Him:
haughty eyes,
a heart that devises wicked schemes,
a false witness who gives false testimony,
My son, keep your father’s commandment,
Bind them always upon your heart;
When you walk, they will guide you;
For this commandment is a lamp, this teaching is a light,
to keep you from the evil woman,
Do not lust in your heart for her beauty
For the levy of the prostitute is poverty,
Can a man embrace fire
Can a man walk on hot coals
So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife;
Men do not despise the thief
Yet if caught, he must pay sevenfold;
He who commits adultery lacks judgment;
Wounds and dishonor will befall him,
For jealousy enrages a husband,
He will not be appeased by any ransom,
