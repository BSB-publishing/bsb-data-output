This is the burden against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz received:
Raise a banner on a barren hilltop;
I have commanded My sanctified ones;
Listen, a tumult on the mountains,
They are coming from faraway lands,
Wail, for the Day of the LORD is near;
Therefore all hands will fall limp,
Terror, pain, and anguish will seize them;
Behold, the Day of the LORD is coming—
For the stars of heaven and their constellations
I will punish the world for its evil
I will make man scarcer than pure gold,
Therefore I will make the heavens tremble,
Like a hunted gazelle,
Whoever is caught will be stabbed,
Their infants will be dashed to pieces
Behold, I will stir up against them the Medes,
Their bows will dash young men to pieces;
And Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms,
She will never be inhabited
But desert creatures will lie down there,
Hyenas will howl in her fortresses
