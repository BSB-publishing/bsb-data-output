Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
“So my anxious thoughts compel me to answer,
I have heard a rebuke that insults me,
Do you not know that from antiquity,
the triumph of the wicked has been brief
Though his arrogance reaches the heavens,
he will perish forever, like his own dung;
He will fly away like a dream, never to be found;
The eye that saw him will see him no more,
His sons will seek the favor of the poor,
The youthful vigor that fills his bones
Though evil is sweet in his mouth
though he cannot bear to let it go
yet in his stomach his food sours
He swallows wealth but vomits it out;
He will suck the poison of cobras;
He will not enjoy the streams,
He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming it;
For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor;
Because his appetite is never satisfied,
Nothing is left for him to consume;
In the midst of his plenty, he will be distressed;
When he has filled his stomach,
Though he flees from an iron weapon,
It is drawn out of his back,
Total darkness is reserved for his treasures.
The heavens will expose his iniquity,
The possessions of his house will be removed,
This is the wicked man’s portion from God,
