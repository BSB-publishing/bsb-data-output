A song. A Psalm of Asaph.
See how Your enemies rage,
With cunning they scheme against Your people
saying, “Come, let us erase them as a nation;
For with one mind they plot together;
the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
of Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,
Even Assyria has joined them,
Do to them as You did to Midian,
who perished at Endor
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
who said, “Let us possess for ourselves
Make them like tumbleweed, O my God,
As fire consumes a forest,
so pursue them with Your tempest,
Cover their faces with shame,
May they be ever ashamed and terrified;
May they know that You alone,
