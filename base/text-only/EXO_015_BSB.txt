Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD:
The LORD is my strength and my song,
The LORD is a warrior,
Pharaoh’s chariots and army
The depths have covered them;
Your right hand, O LORD,
You overthrew Your adversaries
At the blast of Your nostrils
The enemy declared,
But You blew with Your breath,
Who among the gods is like You, O LORD?
You stretched out Your right hand,
With loving devotion
The nations will hear and tremble;
Then the chiefs of Edom will be dismayed;
and terror and dread will fall on them.
You will bring them in and plant them
The LORD will reign forever and ever!”
For when Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them. But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.
Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing.
And Miriam sang back to them:
Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the Desert of Shur. For three days they walked in the desert without finding water.
And when they came to Marah,
So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?”
And Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a log. And when he cast it into the waters, they were sweetened.
saying, “If you will listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His eyes, and pay attention to His commands, and keep all His statutes, then I will not bring on you any of the diseases I inflicted on the Egyptians. For I am the LORD who heals you.”
Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there by the waters.
