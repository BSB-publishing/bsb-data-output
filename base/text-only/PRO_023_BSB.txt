When you sit down to dine with a ruler,
and put a knife to your throat
Do not crave his delicacies,
Do not wear yourself out to get rich;
When you glance at wealth, it disappears,
Do not eat the bread of a stingy man,
for he is keeping track,
You will vomit up what little you have eaten
Do not speak to a fool,
Do not move an ancient boundary stone
for their Redeemer is strong;
Apply your heart to instruction
Do not withhold discipline from a child;
Strike him with a rod,
My son, if your heart is wise,
My inmost being
Do not let your heart envy sinners,
For surely there is a future,
Listen, my son, and be wise,
Do not join those who drink too much wine
For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty,
Listen to your father who gave you life,
Invest in truth and never sell it—
The father of a righteous man will greatly rejoice,
May your father and mother be glad,
My son, give me your heart,
For a prostitute is a deep pit,
Like a robber she lies in wait
Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
Those who linger over wine,
Do not gaze at wine while it is red,
In the end it bites like a snake
Your eyes will see strange things,
You will be like one sleeping on the high seas
“They struck me, but I feel no pain!
