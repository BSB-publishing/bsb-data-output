Hear now what the LORD says:
Hear, O mountains, the LORD’s indictment,
‘My people, what have I done to you?
For I brought you up from the land of Egypt
My people, remember what Balak king of Moab counseled
With what shall I come before the LORD
Would the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,
He has shown you, O man, what is good.
The voice of the LORD calls out to the city
Can I forget any longer,
Can I excuse dishonest scales
For the wealthy of the city
Therefore I am striking you severely,
You will eat but not be satisfied,
You will sow but not reap;
You have kept the statutes of Omri
