Then Elihu continued:
“Hear my words, O wise men;
For the ear tests words
Let us choose for ourselves what is right;
For Job has declared, ‘I am righteous,
Would I lie about my case?
What man is like Job,
He keeps company with evildoers
For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing
Therefore listen to me,
For according to a man’s deeds He repays him;
Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly,
Who gave Him charge over the earth?
If He were to set His heart to it
all flesh would perish together
If you have understanding, hear this;
Could one who hates justice govern?
who says to kings, ‘You are worthless!’
who is not partial to princes
They die in an instant,
For His eyes are on the ways of a man,
There is no darkness or deep shadow
For God need not examine a man further
He shatters the mighty without inquiry
Therefore, He recognizes their deeds;
He strikes them for their wickedness
because they turned aside from Him
They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him,
But when He remains silent, who can condemn Him?
that godless men should not rule
Suppose someone says to God,
Teach me what I cannot see;
Should God repay you on your own terms
Men of understanding will declare to me,
‘Job speaks without knowledge;
If only Job were tried to the utmost
For he adds rebellion to his sin;
