Woe is me!
The godly man has perished from the earth;
Both hands are skilled at evil;
The best of them is like a brier;
Do not rely on a friend;
For a son dishonors his father,
But as for me, I will look to the LORD;
Do not gloat over me, my enemy!
Because I have sinned against Him,
Then my enemy will see
The day for rebuilding your walls will come —
On that day they will come to you
Then the earth will become desolate
Shepherd with Your staff Your people,
As in the days when you came out of Egypt,
Nations will see and be ashamed,
They will lick the dust like a snake,
Who is a God like You,
He will again have compassion on us;
You will show faithfulness to Jacob
