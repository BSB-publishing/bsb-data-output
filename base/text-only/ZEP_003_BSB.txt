Woe to the city of oppressors,
She heeded no voice;
Her princes are roaring lions;
Her prophets are reckless,
The LORD within her is righteous;
“I have cut off the nations;
I said, ‘Surely you will fear Me
Therefore wait for Me,”
For then I will restore
From beyond the rivers of Cush
On that day you will not be put to shame
But I will leave within you a meek and humble people,
The remnant of Israel
Sing for joy, O Daughter of Zion;
The LORD has taken away your punishment;
On that day they will say to Jerusalem:
The LORD your God is among you;
“I will gather those among you who grieve
Behold, at that time,
At that time I will bring you in;
