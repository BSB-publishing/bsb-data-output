This is the vision of Obadiah:
“Behold, I will make you small among the nations;
The pride of your heart has deceived you,
Though you soar like the eagle
“If thieves came to you,
But how Esau will be pillaged,
All the men allied with you
In that day, declares the LORD,
Then your mighty men, O Teman,
Because of the violence against your brother Jacob,
On the day you stood aloof
But you should not gloat in that day,
You should not enter the gate of My people
Nor should you stand at the crossroads
For the Day of the LORD is near
For as you drank on My holy mountain,
But on Mount Zion there will be deliverance,
Then the house of Jacob will be a blazing fire,
Those from the Negev will possess the mountains of Esau;
And the exiles of this host of the Israelites
The deliverers will ascend
