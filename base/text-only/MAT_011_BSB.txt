After Jesus had finished instructing His twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.
Meanwhile John heard in prison about the works of Christ, and he sent his disciples
to ask Him, “Are You the One who was to come, or should we look for someone else?”
Jesus replied,
The blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers
Blessed is the one who does not fall away on account of Me.
As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John:
Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Look, those who wear fine clothing are found in kings’ palaces.
What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
This is the one about whom it is written:
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subject to violence,
For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at this glutton and drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is vindicated by her actions.”
Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of His miracles had been performed, because they did not repent.
“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.”
At that time Jesus declared,
Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing in Your sight.
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”
