This is what the LORD says:
Why was no one there when I arrived?
I clothe the heavens in black
The Lord GOD has given Me
The Lord GOD has opened My ears,
I offered My back to those who struck Me,
Because the Lord GOD helps Me,
The One who vindicates Me is near.
Surely the Lord GOD helps Me.
Who among you fears the LORD
Behold, all you who kindle a fire,
