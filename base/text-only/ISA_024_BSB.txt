Behold, the LORD lays waste the earth
people and priest alike, servant and master,
The earth will be utterly laid waste
The earth mourns and withers;
The earth is defiled by its people;
Therefore a curse has consumed the earth,
The new wine dries up, the vine withers.
The joyful tambourines have ceased;
They no longer sing and drink wine;
The city of chaos is shattered;
In the streets they cry out for wine.
The city is left in ruins;
So will it be on the earth
They raise their voices, they shout for joy;
Therefore glorify the LORD in the east.
From the ends of the earth we hear singing:
Terror and pit and snare await you,
Whoever flees the sound of panic
The earth is utterly broken apart,
The earth staggers like a drunkard
In that day the LORD will punish
They will be gathered together
The moon will be confounded
