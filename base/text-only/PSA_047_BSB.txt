For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.
How awesome is the LORD Most High,
He subdues nations beneath us,
He chooses our inheritance for us,
God has ascended amid shouts of joy,
Sing praises to God, sing praises;
For God is King of all the earth;
God reigns over the nations;
The nobles of the nations have assembled
