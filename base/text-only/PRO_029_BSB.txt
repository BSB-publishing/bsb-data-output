A man who remains stiff-necked after much reproof
When the righteous flourish, the people rejoice,
A man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father,
By justice a king brings stability to the land,
A man who flatters his neighbor
An evil man is caught by his own sin,
The righteous consider the cause of the poor,
Mockers inflame a city,
If a wise man goes to court with a fool,
Men of bloodshed hate a blameless man,
A fool vents all his anger,
If a ruler listens to lies,
The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:
A king who judges the poor with fairness—
A rod of correction imparts wisdom,
When the wicked thrive, rebellion increases;
Discipline your son, and he will give you rest;
Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint;
A servant cannot be corrected by words alone;
Do you see a man who speaks in haste?
A servant pampered from his youth
An angry man stirs up dissension,
A man’s pride will bring him low,
A partner to a thief hates his own soul;
The fear of man is a snare,
Many seek the ruler’s favor,
An unjust man is detestable to the righteous,
