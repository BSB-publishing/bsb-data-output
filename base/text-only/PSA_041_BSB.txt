For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
The LORD will protect and preserve him;
The LORD will sustain him on his bed of illness
I said, “O LORD, be gracious to me;
My enemies say with malice:
My visitor speaks falsehood;
All who hate me whisper against me;
“A vile disease has been poured into him;
Even my close friend whom I trusted,
But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up,
By this I know that You delight in me,
In my integrity You uphold me
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
