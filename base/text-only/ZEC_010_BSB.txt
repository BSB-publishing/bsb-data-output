Ask the LORD for rain in springtime;
For idols speak deceit
“My anger burns against the shepherds,
The cornerstone will come from Judah,
They will be like mighty men in battle,
I will strengthen the house of Judah
Ephraim will be like a mighty man,
I will whistle for them to gather,
Though I sow them among the nations,
I will bring them back from Egypt
They will pass through the sea of distress
I will strengthen them in the LORD,
