Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Son of man, pose a riddle; speak a parable to the house of Israel
and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says:
He plucked off its topmost shoot,
He took some of the seed of the land
It sprouted and became a spreading vine,
But there was another great eagle
It had been planted in good soil
So you are to tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says:
Even if it is transplanted,
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Now say to this rebellious house: ‘Do you not know what these things mean?’
He took a member of the royal family
so that the kingdom would be brought low, unable to lift itself up, surviving only by keeping his covenant.
But this king rebelled against Babylon by sending his envoys to Egypt to ask for horses and a large army. Will he flourish? Will the one who does such things escape? Can he break a covenant and yet escape?’
‘As surely as I live,’ declares the Lord GOD, ‘he will die in Babylon, in the land of the king who enthroned him, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke.
Pharaoh with his mighty army and vast horde will not help him in battle, when ramps are built and siege walls constructed to destroy many lives.
He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. Seeing that he gave his hand in pledge yet did all these things, he will not escape!’
Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘As surely as I live, I will bring down upon his head My oath that he despised and My covenant that he broke.
I will spread My net over him and catch him in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment upon him there for the treason he committed against Me.
All his choice troops
This is what the Lord GOD says:
I will plant it on the mountain heights of Israel
Then all the trees of the field will know
