For the choirmaster. For Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.
I was speechless and still;
My heart grew hot within me;
“Show me, O LORD, my end
You, indeed, have made my days as handbreadths,
Surely every man goes about like a phantom;
And now, O Lord, for what do I wait?
Deliver me from all my transgressions;
I have become mute;
Remove Your scourge from me;
You discipline and correct a man for his iniquity,
Hear my prayer, O LORD,
Turn Your gaze away from me,
