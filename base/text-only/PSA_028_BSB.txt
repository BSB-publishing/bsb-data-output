Of David.
Hear my cry for mercy
Do not drag me away with the wicked,
Repay them according to their deeds
Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD
Blessed be the LORD,
The LORD is my strength and my shield;
The LORD is the strength of His people,
Save Your people and bless Your inheritance;
