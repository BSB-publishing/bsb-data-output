For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. When Nathan the prophet came to him after his adultery with Bathsheba.
Wash me clean of my iniquity
For I know my transgressions,
Against You, You only, have I sinned
Surely I was brought forth in iniquity;
Surely You desire truth in the inmost being;
Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean;
Let me hear joy and gladness;
Hide Your face from my sins
Create in me a clean heart, O God,
Cast me not away from Your presence;
Restore to me the joy of Your salvation,
Then I will teach transgressors Your ways,
Deliver me from bloodguilt, O God,
O Lord, open my lips,
For You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it;
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;
In Your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper;
Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices,
