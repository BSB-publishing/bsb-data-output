Who has believed our message?
He grew up before Him like a tender shoot,
He was despised and rejected by men,
Surely He took up our infirmities
But He was pierced for our transgressions,
We all like sheep have gone astray,
He was oppressed and afflicted,
By oppression and judgment He was taken away,
He was assigned a grave with the wicked,
Yet it was the LORD’s will to crush Him
After the anguish of His soul,
Therefore I will allot Him a portion with the great,
