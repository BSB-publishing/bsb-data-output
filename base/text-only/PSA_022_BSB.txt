For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Doe of the Dawn.” A Psalm of David.
I cry out by day, O my God,
Yet You are holy,
In You our fathers trusted;
They cried out to You and were set free;
But I am a worm and not a man,
All who see me mock me;
“He trusts in the LORD,
Yet You brought me forth from the womb;
From birth I was cast upon You;
Be not far from me,
Many bulls surround me;
They open their jaws against me
I am poured out like water,
My strength
For dogs surround me;
I can count all my bones;
They divide my garments among them
But You, O LORD, be not far off;
Deliver my soul from the sword,
Save me from the mouth of the lion;
I will proclaim Your name to my brothers;
You who fear the LORD, praise Him!
For He has not despised or detested
My praise for You resounds in the great assembly;
The poor will eat and be satisfied;
All the ends of the earth
For dominion belongs to the LORD
All the rich of the earth will feast and worship;
Posterity will serve Him;
They will come and proclaim His righteousness
