I will sing for my beloved a song of his vineyard:
He dug it up and cleared the stones
“And now, O dwellers of Jerusalem
What more could have been done for My vineyard
Now I will tell you what I am about to do to My vineyard:
I will make it a wasteland,
For the vineyard of the LORD of Hosts
Woe to you who add house to house
I heard the LORD of Hosts declare:
For ten acres of vineyard
Woe to those who rise early in the morning
At their feasts are the lyre and harp,
Therefore My people will go into exile
Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat
So mankind will be brought low, and each man humbled;
But the LORD of Hosts will be exalted by His justice,
Lambs will graze as in their own pastures,
Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of deceit
to those who say, “Let Him hurry and hasten His work
Woe to those who call evil good
Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes
Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine
who acquit the guilty for a bribe
Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes the straw,
Therefore the anger of the LORD burns against His people;
He lifts a banner for the distant nations
None of them grows weary or stumbles;
Their arrows are sharpened,
Their roaring is like that of a lion;
In that day they will roar over it,
