For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lilies of the Covenant.” A Psalm of Asaph.
before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh.
Restore us, O God,
O LORD God of Hosts,
You fed them with the bread of tears
You make us contend with our neighbors;
Restore us, O God of Hosts,
You uprooted a vine from Egypt;
You cleared the ground for it,
The mountains were covered by its shade,
It sent out its branches to the Sea,
Why have You broken down its walls,
The boar from the forest ravages it,
Return, O God of Hosts, we pray!
the root Your right hand has planted,
Your vine has been cut down and burned;
Let Your hand be upon the man at Your right hand,
Then we will not turn away from You;
Restore us, O LORD God of Hosts;
