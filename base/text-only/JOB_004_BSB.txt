Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
“If one ventures a word with you, will you be wearied?
Surely you have instructed many,
Your words have steadied those who stumbled;
But now trouble has come upon you, and you are weary.
Is your reverence not your confidence,
Consider now, I plead:
As I have observed, those who plow iniquity
By the breath of God they perish,
The lion may roar, and the fierce lion may growl,
The old lion perishes for lack of prey,
Now a word came to me secretly;
In disquieting visions in the night,
fear and trembling came over me
Then a spirit
It stood still,
‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God,
If God puts no trust in His servants,
how much more those who dwell in houses of clay,
They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk;
Are not their tent cords pulled up,
