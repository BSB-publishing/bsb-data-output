And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Son of man, tell the ruler of Tyre that this is what the Lord GOD says:
Behold, you are wiser than Daniel;
By your wisdom and understanding
By your great skill in trading
Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
behold, I will bring foreigners against you,
They will bring you down to the Pit,
Will you still say, ‘I am a god,’
You will die the death of the uncircumcised
Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Son of man, take up a lament for the king of Tyre and tell him that this is what the Lord GOD says:
You were in Eden,
You were anointed as a guardian cherub,
From the day you were created
By the vastness of your trade,
Your heart grew proud of your beauty;
By the multitude of your iniquities
All the nations who know you
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Son of man, set your face against Sidon and prophesy against her.
And you are to declare that this is what the Lord GOD says:
I will send a plague against her
For the people of Israel will no longer face a pricking brier or a painful thorn from all around them who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.’
This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they have been scattered, I will show Myself holy among them in the sight of the nations.
And there they will dwell securely, build houses, and plant vineyards. They will dwell securely when I execute judgments against all those around them who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.’”
