Hallelujah!
Great are the works of the LORD;
Splendid and majestic is His work;
He has caused His wonders to be remembered;
He provides food for those who fear Him;
He has shown His people the power of His works
The works of His hands are truth and justice;
They are upheld forever and ever,
He has sent redemption to His people;
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom;
