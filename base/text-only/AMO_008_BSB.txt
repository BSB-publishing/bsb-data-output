This is what the Lord GOD showed me: I saw a basket of summer fruit.
“Amos, what do you see?” He asked.
“In that day,” declares the Lord GOD, “the songs
Hear this, you who trample the needy,
asking, “When will the New Moon be over,
Let us buy the poor with silver
The LORD has sworn by the Pride of Jacob:
Will not the land quake for this,
And in that day,
I will turn your feasts into mourning
Behold, the days are coming,
People will stagger from sea to sea
In that day the lovely young women —
Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria
