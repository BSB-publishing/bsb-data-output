A Psalm of praise. Of David.
Every day I will bless You,
Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised;
One generation will commend Your works to the next,
the glorious splendor of Your majesty.
They will proclaim the power of Your awesome deeds,
They will extol the fame of Your abundant goodness
The LORD is gracious and compassionate,
The LORD is good to all;
All You have made will give You thanks, O LORD,
They will tell of the glory of Your kingdom
to make known to men Your mighty acts
Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
The LORD upholds all who fall
The eyes of all look to You,
You open Your hand
The LORD is righteous in all His ways
The LORD is near to all who call on Him,
He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him;
The LORD preserves all who love Him,
My mouth will declare the praise of the LORD;
