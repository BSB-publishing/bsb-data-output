For the choirmaster. A Maskil
With Your hand You drove out the nations
For it was not by their sword that they took the land;
You are my King, O God,
Through You we repel our foes;
For I do not trust in my bow,
For You save us from our enemies;
In God we have boasted all day long,
But You have rejected and humbled us;
You have made us retreat from the foe,
You have given us up as sheep to be devoured;
You sell Your people for nothing;
You have made us a reproach to our neighbors,
You have made us a byword among the nations,
All day long my disgrace is before me,
at the voice of the scorner and reviler,
All this has come upon us,
Our hearts have not turned back;
But You have crushed us in the lair of jackals;
If we had forgotten the name of our God
would not God have discovered,
Yet for Your sake we face death all day long;
Wake up, O Lord! Why are You sleeping?
Why do You hide Your face
For our soul has sunk to the dust;
Rise up; be our help!
