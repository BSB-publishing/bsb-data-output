Better a poor man who walks with integrity
Even zeal is no good without knowledge,
A man’s own folly subverts his way,
Wealth attracts many friends,
A false witness will not go unpunished,
Many seek the favor of the prince,
All the brothers of a poor man hate him —
He who acquires wisdom loves himself;
A false witness will not go unpunished,
Luxury is unseemly for a fool—
A man’s insight gives him patience,
A king’s rage is like the roar of a lion,
A foolish son is his father’s ruin,
Houses and wealth are inherited from fathers,
Laziness brings on deep sleep,
He who keeps a commandment preserves his soul,
Kindness to the poor is a loan to the LORD,
Discipline your son, for in that there is hope;
A man of great anger must pay the penalty;
Listen to counsel and accept discipline,
Many plans are in a man’s heart,
The desire of a man is loving devotion;
The fear of the LORD leads to life,
The slacker buries his hand in the dish;
Strike a mocker, and the simple will beware;
He who assaults his father or evicts his mother
If you cease to hear instruction, my son,
A corrupt witness mocks justice,
Judgments are prepared for mockers,
