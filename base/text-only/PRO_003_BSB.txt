My son, do not forget my teaching,
for they will add length to your days,
Never let loving devotion
Then you will find favor and high regard
Trust in the LORD with all your heart,
in all your ways acknowledge Him,
Be not wise in your own eyes;
This will bring healing to your body
Honor the LORD with your wealth
then your barns will be filled with plenty,
My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD,
for the LORD disciplines the one He loves,
Blessed is the man who finds wisdom,
for she is more profitable than silver,
She is more precious than rubies;
Long life is in her right hand;
All her ways are pleasant,
She is a tree of life to those who embrace her,
The LORD founded the earth by wisdom
By His knowledge the watery depths were broken open,
My son, do not lose sight of this:
They will be life to your soul
Then you will go on your way in safety,
When you lie down, you will not be afraid;
Do not fear sudden danger
for the LORD will be your confidence
Do not withhold good from the deserving
Do not tell your neighbor,
Do not devise evil against your neighbor,
Do not accuse a man without cause,
Do not envy a violent man
for the LORD detests the perverse,
The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked,
He mocks the mockers,
The wise will inherit honor,
