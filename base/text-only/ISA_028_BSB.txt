Woe to the majestic crown of Ephraim’s
Behold, the Lord has one
The majestic crown of Ephraim’s drunkards
The fading flower of his beautiful splendor,
On that day the LORD of Hosts will be a crown of glory,
a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,
These also stagger from wine
For all their tables are covered with vomit;
Whom is He trying to teach?
For they hear:
Indeed, with mocking lips and foreign tongues,
to whom He has said:
Then the word of the LORD to them will become:
Therefore hear the word of the LORD, O scoffers
For you said, “We have made a covenant with death;
So this is what the Lord GOD says:
I will make justice the measuring line
Your covenant with death will be dissolved,
As often as it passes through,
Indeed, the bed is too short to stretch out on,
For the LORD will rise up as at Mount Perazim.
So now, do not mock,
Listen and hear my voice.
Does the plowman plow for planting every day?
When he has leveled its surface,
For his God instructs
Surely caraway is not threshed with a sledge,
Grain for bread must be ground,
This also comes from the LORD of Hosts,
