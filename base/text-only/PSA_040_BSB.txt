For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
He lifted me up from the pit of despair,
He put a new song in my mouth,
Blessed is the man
Many, O LORD my God,
Sacrifice and offering You did not desire,
Then I said, “Here I am, I have come —
I delight to do Your will, O my God;
I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly;
I have not covered up Your righteousness in my heart;
O LORD, do not withhold Your mercy from me;
For evils without number surround me;
Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me;
May those who seek my life
May those who say to me, “Aha, aha!”
May all who seek You
But I am poor and needy;
