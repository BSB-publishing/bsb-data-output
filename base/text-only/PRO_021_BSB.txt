The king’s heart is a waterway in the hand of the LORD;
All a man’s ways seem right to him,
To do righteousness and justice
Haughty eyes and a proud heart—
The plans of the diligent bring plenty,
Making a fortune by a lying tongue
The violence of the wicked will sweep them away
The way of a guilty man is crooked,
Better to live on a corner of the roof
The soul of the wicked man craves evil;
When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom;
The Righteous One
Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor,
A gift in secret soothes anger,
Justice executed is a joy to the righteous,
The man who strays from the path of understanding
He who loves pleasure will become poor;
The wicked become a ransom for the righteous,
Better to live in the desert
Precious treasures and oil are in the dwelling of the wise,
He who pursues righteousness and loving devotion
A wise man scales the city of the mighty
He who guards his mouth and tongue
Mocker is the name of the proud and arrogant man —
The craving of the slacker kills him
All day long he covets more,
The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable—
A lying witness will perish,
A wicked man hardens his face,
There is no wisdom, no understanding, no counsel
A horse is prepared for the day of battle,
