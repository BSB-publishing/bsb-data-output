How
Without pity the Lord has swallowed up
In fierce anger He has cut off
He has bent His bow like an enemy;
The Lord is like an enemy;
He has laid waste His tabernacle like a garden booth;
The Lord has rejected His altar;
The LORD determined to destroy
Her gates have sunk into the ground;
The elders of the Daughter of Zion
My eyes fail from weeping;
They cry out to their mothers:
What can I say for you?
The visions of your prophets
All who pass by
All your enemies
The LORD has done what He planned;
The hearts of the people
Arise, cry out in the night
Look, O LORD, and consider:
Both young and old lie together
You summoned my terrors on every side,
