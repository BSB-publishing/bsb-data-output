“The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus,
Even their children remember their altars and Asherah poles
O My mountain in the countryside,
And you yourself will relinquish
This is what the LORD says:
He will be like a shrub in the desert;
But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD,
He is like a tree planted by the waters
The heart is deceitful above all things
I, the LORD, search the heart;
Like a partridge hatching eggs it did not lay
A glorious throne, exalted from the beginning,
O LORD, the hope of Israel,
Heal me, O LORD, and I will be healed;
Behold, they keep saying to me,
But I have not run away from being Your shepherd;
Do not become a terror to me;
Let my persecutors be put to shame,
This is what the LORD said to me: “Go and stand at the gate of the people, through which the kings of Judah go in and out; and stand at all the other gates of Jerusalem.
Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, all people of Judah and Jerusalem who enter through these gates.
This is what the LORD says: Take heed for yourselves; do not carry a load or bring it through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day.
You must not carry a load out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath day, but you must keep the Sabbath day holy, just as I commanded your forefathers.
Yet they would not listen or incline their ear, but they stiffened their necks and would not listen or receive My discipline.
If, however, you listen carefully to Me, says the LORD, and bring no load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, and keep the Sabbath day holy, and do no work on it,
then kings and princes will enter through the gates of this city. They will sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses with their officials, along with the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever.
And people will come from the cities of Judah and the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, and from the foothills,
But if you do not listen to Me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying a load while entering the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle an unquenchable fire in its gates to consume the citadels of Jerusalem.’”
