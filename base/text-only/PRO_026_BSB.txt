Like snow in summer and rain at harvest,
Like a fluttering sparrow or darting swallow,
A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,
Do not answer a fool according to his folly,
Answer a fool according to his folly,
Like cutting off one’s own feet or drinking violence
Like lame legs hanging limp
Like binding a stone into a sling
Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard
Like an archer who wounds at random
As a dog returns to its vomit,
Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes?
The slacker says, “A lion is in the road!
As a door turns on its hinges,
The slacker buries his hand in the dish;
The slacker is wiser in his own eyes
Like one who grabs a dog by the ears
Like a madman shooting firebrands
so is the man who deceives his neighbor
Without wood, a fire goes out;
Like charcoal for embers and wood for fire,
The words of a gossip are like choice morsels
Like glaze covering an earthen vessel
A hateful man disguises himself with his speech,
When he speaks graciously, do not believe him,
Though his hatred is concealed by deception,
He who digs a pit will fall into it,
A lying tongue hates those it crushes,
