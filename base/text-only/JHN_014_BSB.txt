“Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God;
In My Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and welcome you into My presence, so that you also may be where I am.
You know the way to the place where I am going.
“Lord,” said Thomas, “we do not know where You are going, so how can we know the way?”
Jesus answered,
If you had known Me, you would know My Father as well. From now on you do know Him and have seen Him.”
Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”
Jesus replied,
Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words I say to you, I do not speak on My own. Instead, it is the Father dwelling in Me, performing His works.
Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me — or at least believe on account of the works themselves.
And I will do whatever you ask in My name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
If you ask Me
And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate
the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive Him, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. But you do know Him, for He abides with you and will be in you.
In a little while the world will see Me no more, but you will see Me. Because I live, you also will live.
On that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you are in Me, and I am in you.
Whoever has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me. The one who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and reveal Myself to him.”
Judas (not Iscariot) asked Him, “Lord, why are You going to reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?”
Jesus replied,
Whoever does not love Me does not keep My words. The word that you hear is not My own, but it is  from the Father who sent Me.
But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have told you.
You heard Me say, ‘I am going away, and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved Me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I.
And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it does happen, you will believe.
But I do exactly what the Father has commanded Me, so that the world may know that I love the Father.
