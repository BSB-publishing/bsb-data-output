This is the burden that Habakkuk the prophet received in a vision:
How long, O LORD, must I call for help
Why do You make me see iniquity?
Therefore the law is paralyzed,
“Look at the nations and observe—
For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans
They are dreaded and feared;
Their horses are swifter than leopards,
All of them come bent on violence;
They scoff at kings
Then they sweep by like the wind
Are You not from everlasting,
Your eyes are too pure to look upon evil,
You have made men like the fish of the sea,
The foe pulls all of them up
Therefore he sacrifices to his dragnet
Will he, therefore, empty his net
