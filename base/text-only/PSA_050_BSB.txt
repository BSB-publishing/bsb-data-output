A Psalm of Asaph.
From Zion, perfect in beauty,
Our God approaches and will not be silent!
He summons the heavens above,
“Gather to Me My saints,
And the heavens proclaim His righteousness,
“Hear, O My people, and I will speak,
I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices,
I have no need for a bull from your stall
for every beast of the forest is Mine —
I know every bird in the mountains,
If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
Do I eat the flesh of bulls,
Sacrifice a thank offering to God,
Call upon Me in the day of trouble;
To the wicked, however, God says,
For you hate My instruction
When you see a thief, you befriend him,
You unleash your mouth for evil
You sit and malign your brother;
You have done these things, and I kept silent;
Now consider this, you who forget God,
He who sacrifices a thank offering honors Me,
