Without growing weary, you have persevered and endured many things for the sake of My name.
Therefore, keep in mind how far you have fallen. Repent and perform the deeds you did at first. But if you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
In the same way, some of you also hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
Therefore repent! Otherwise I will come to you shortly and wage war against them with the sword of My mouth.
Even though I have given her time to repent of her immorality, she is unwilling.
Then I will strike her children dead, and all the churches will know that I am the One who searches minds and hearts, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.
than to hold fast to what you have until I come.
And to the one who overcomes and continues in My work until the end, I will give authority over the nations.
He will rule them with an iron scepter and shatter them like pottery
And I will give him the morning star.
