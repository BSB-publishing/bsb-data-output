A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day.
to proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning
with the ten-stringed harp
For You, O LORD, have made me glad by Your deeds;
How great are Your works, O LORD,
A senseless man does not know,
that though the wicked sprout like grass,
But You, O LORD, are exalted forever!
For surely Your enemies, O LORD,
But You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox;
My eyes see the downfall of my enemies;
The righteous will flourish like a palm tree,
Planted in the house of the LORD,
In old age they will still bear fruit;
to proclaim, “The LORD is upright; He is my Rock,
