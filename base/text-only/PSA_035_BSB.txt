Of David.
Take up Your shield and buckler;
Draw the spear and javelin
May those who seek my life
May they be like chaff in the wind,
May their path be dark and slick,
For without cause they laid their net for me;
May ruin befall them by surprise;
Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD
All my bones will exclaim,
Hostile witnesses come forward;
They repay me evil for good,
Yet when they were ill,
I paced about
But when I stumbled, they assembled in glee;
Like godless jesters at a feast,
How long, O Lord, will You look on?
Then I will give You thanks in the great assembly;
Let not my enemies gloat over me without cause,
For they do not speak peace,
They gape at me and say,
O LORD, You have seen it; be not silent.
Awake and rise to my defense,
Vindicate me by Your righteousness, O LORD my God,
Let them not say in their hearts,
May those who gloat in my distress
May those who favor my vindication
Then my tongue will proclaim Your righteousness
