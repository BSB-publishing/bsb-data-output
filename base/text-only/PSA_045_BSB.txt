For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lilies.” A Maskil
You are the most handsome of men;
Strap your sword at your side, O mighty warrior;
In your splendor ride forth in victory
Your arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s foes;
Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever,
You have loved righteousness
All your garments are fragrant
The daughters of kings are among your honored women;
Listen, O daughter! Consider and incline your ear:
and the king will desire your beauty;
The Daughter of Tyre will come with a gift;
All glorious is the princess in her chamber;
In colorful garments she is led to the king;
They are led in with joy and gladness;
Your sons will succeed your fathers;
I will commemorate your name through all generations;
