This is the word of the LORD that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah:
“I will completely sweep away
“I will sweep away man and beast;
“I will stretch out My hand against Judah
those who bow on the rooftops
and those who turn back
Be silent in the presence of the Lord GOD,
“On the Day of the LORD’s sacrifice
On that day I will punish
On that day,” declares the LORD,
Wail, O dwellers of the Hollow,
And at that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps
Their wealth will be plundered
The great Day of the LORD is near —
That day will be
a day of horn blast and battle cry
I will bring such distress on mankind
Neither their silver nor their gold
