The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on Me,
to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor
to console the mourners in Zion —
They will rebuild the ancient ruins;
Strangers will stand and feed your flocks,
But you will be called the priests of the LORD;
Instead of shame, My people will have a double portion,
For I, the LORD, love justice;
Their descendants will be known among the nations,
I will rejoice greatly in the LORD,
For as the earth brings forth its growth,
