Righteous are You, O LORD,
You planted them, and they have taken root.
But You know me, O LORD;
How long will the land mourn
“If you have raced with men on foot
Even your brothers—
I have forsaken My house;
My inheritance has become to Me
Is not My inheritance to Me
Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard;
They have made it a desolation;
Over all the barren heights in the wilderness
They have sown wheat but harvested thorns.
This is what the LORD says: “As for all My evil neighbors who attack the inheritance that I bequeathed to My people Israel, I am about to uproot them from their land, and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them.
But after I have uprooted them, I will once again have compassion on them and return each one to his inheritance and to his land.
And if they will diligently learn the ways of My people and swear by My name, saying, ‘As surely as the LORD lives’— just as they once taught My people to swear by Baal— then they will be established among My people.
But if they will not obey, then I will uproot that nation; I will uproot it and destroy it, declares the LORD.”
