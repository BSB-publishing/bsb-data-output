“Here is My Servant, whom I uphold,
He will not cry out or raise His voice,
A bruised reed He will not break
He will not grow weak or discouraged
This is what God the LORD says—
“I, the LORD, have called you
to open the eyes of the blind,
I am the LORD;
Behold, the former things have happened,
Sing to the LORD a new song—
Let the desert and its cities raise their voices;
Let them give glory to the LORD
The LORD goes forth like a mighty one;
“I have kept silent from ages past;
I will lay waste the mountains and hills
I will lead the blind by a way they did not know;
But those who trust in idols
Listen, you deaf ones;
Who is blind but My servant,
Though seeing many things, you do not keep watch.
The LORD was pleased, for the sake of His righteousness,
But this is a people plundered and looted,
Who among you will pay attention to this?
Who gave Jacob up for spoil,
So He poured out on them His furious anger
