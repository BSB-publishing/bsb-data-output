The wicked flee when no one pursues,
A land in rebellion has many rulers,
A destitute leader who oppresses the poor
Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,
Evil men do not understand justice,
Better a poor man who walks with integrity
A discerning son keeps the law,
He who increases his wealth by interest and usury
Whoever turns his ear away from hearing the law,
He who leads the upright along the path of evil will fall into his own pit,
A rich man is wise in his own eyes,
When the righteous triumph, there is great glory,
He who conceals his sins will not prosper,
Blessed is the man who is always reverent,
Like a roaring lion or a charging bear
A leader who lacks judgment is also a great oppressor,
A man burdened by bloodguilt will flee into the Pit;
He who walks with integrity will be kept safe,
The one who works his land will have plenty of food,
A faithful man will abound with blessings,
To show partiality is not good,
A stingy man
He who rebukes a man will later find more favor
He who robs his father or mother, saying, “It is not wrong,”
A greedy man stirs up strife,
He who trusts in himself is a fool,
Whoever gives to the poor will not be in need,
When the wicked come to power, people hide themselves;
