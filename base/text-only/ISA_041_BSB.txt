“Be silent before Me, O islands,
Who has aroused one from the east
He pursues them, going on safely,
Who has performed this and carried it out,
The islands see and fear;
Each one helps the other
The craftsman encourages the goldsmith,
“But you, O Israel, My servant,
I brought you from the ends of the earth
Do not fear, for I am with you;
Behold, all who rage against you
You will seek them but will not find them.
For I am the LORD your God,
Do not fear, O Jacob, you worm,
Behold, I will make you into a threshing sledge,
You will winnow them, and a wind will carry them away;
The poor and needy seek water, but there is none;
I will open rivers on the barren heights,
I will plant cedars in the wilderness,
so that all may see and know,
“Present your case,” says the LORD.
“Let them come and tell us what will happen.
Tell us the things that are to come,
Behold, you are nothing
I have raised up one from the north, and he has come —
Who has declared this from the beginning,
I was the first to tell Zion:
When I look, there is no one;
See, they are all a delusion;
