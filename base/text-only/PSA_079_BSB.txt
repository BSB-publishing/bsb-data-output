A Psalm of Asaph.
They have given the corpses of Your servants
They have poured out their blood like water
We have become a reproach to our neighbors,
How long, O LORD?
Pour out Your wrath on the nations
for they have devoured Jacob
Do not hold past sins against us;
Help us, O God of our salvation,
Why should the nations ask,
May the groans of the captives reach You;
Pay back into the laps of our neighbors
Then we Your people, the sheep of Your pasture,
