For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.
He alone is my rock and my salvation.
How long will you threaten a man?
They fully intend to cast him down from his lofty perch;
Rest in God alone, O my soul,
He alone is my rock and my salvation;
My salvation and my honor rest on God, my strong rock;
Trust in Him at all times, O people;
Lowborn men are but a vapor;
Place no trust in extortion
God has spoken once;
and loving devotion to You, O Lord.
