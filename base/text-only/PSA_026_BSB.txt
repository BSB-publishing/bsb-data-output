Of David.
Test me, O LORD, and try me;
For Your loving devotion is before my eyes,
I do not sit with deceitful men,
I hate the mob of evildoers,
I wash my hands in innocence
to raise my voice in thanksgiving
O LORD, I love the house where You dwell,
Do not take my soul away with sinners,
in whose hands are wicked schemes,
But I will walk with integrity;
My feet stand on level ground;
