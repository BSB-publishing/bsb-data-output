Of Solomon.
May he judge Your people with righteousness
May the mountains bring peace to the people,
May he vindicate the afflicted among the people;
May they fear him
May he be like rain that falls on freshly cut grass,
May the righteous flourish in his days
May he rule from sea to sea,
May the nomads bow before him,
May the kings of Tarshish and distant shores bring tribute;
May all kings bow down to him
For he will deliver the needy who cry out
He will take pity on the poor and needy
He will redeem them from oppression and violence,
Long may he live!
May there be an abundance of grain in the land;
May his name endure forever;
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel,
And blessed be His glorious name forever;
Thus conclude the prayers of David son of Jesse.
