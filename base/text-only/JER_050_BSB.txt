This is the word that the LORD spoke through Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon and the land of the Chaldeans:
“Announce and declare to the nations;
For a nation from the north will come against her;
“In those days and at that time,
They will ask the way to Zion
My people are lost sheep;
All who found them devoured them,
Flee from the midst of Babylon;
For behold, I stir up and bring against Babylon
Chaldea
“Because you rejoice,
your mother will be greatly ashamed;
Because of the wrath of the LORD,
Line up in formation around Babylon,
Raise a war cry against her on every side!
Cut off the sower from Babylon,
Israel is a scattered flock,
Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
I will return Israel to his pasture,
In those days and at that time,
Go up against the land of Merathaim,
“The noise of battle is in the land —
How the hammer of the whole earth
I laid a snare for you, O Babylon,
The LORD has opened His armory
Come against her
Kill all her young bulls;
Listen to the fugitives and refugees
Summon the archers against Babylon,
Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets,
“Behold, I am against you, O arrogant one,”
The arrogant one will stumble and fall
This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
Their Redeemer is strong;
A sword is against the Chaldeans,
A sword is against her false prophets,
A sword is against her horses and chariots
A drought is upon her waters,
So the desert creatures and hyenas will live there
As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah
Behold, an army is coming from the north;
They grasp the bow and spear;
The king of Babylon has heard the report,
Behold, one will come up like a lion
Therefore hear the plans
At the sound of Babylon’s capture the earth will quake;
