And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not seek omens as on previous occasions, but he turned his face toward the wilderness.
When Balaam looked up and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came upon him,
and he lifted up an oracle, saying:
the prophecy of one who hears the words of God,
How lovely are your tents, O Jacob,
They spread out like palm groves,
Water will flow from his buckets,
God brought him out of Egypt
He crouches, he lies down like a lion,
Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together and said to Balaam, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have persisted in blessing them these three times.
Therefore , flee at once to your home! I said I would reward you richly, but instead the LORD has denied your reward.”
Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not already tell the messengers you sent me
that even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD? I must speak whatever the LORD says.
Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you what this people will do to your people in the days to come.”
Then Balaam lifted up an oracle, saying,
the prophecy of one who hears the words of God,
I see him, but not now;
Edom will become a possession,
A ruler will come from Jacob
Then Balaam saw Amalek and lifted up an oracle, saying:
Next he saw the Kenites and lifted up an oracle, saying:
Yet Kain will be destroyed
Once more Balaam lifted up an oracle, saying:
Ships will come from the coasts of Cyprus;
Then Balaam arose and returned to his homeland, and Balak also went on his way.
