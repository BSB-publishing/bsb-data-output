Blessed
Blessed are those who keep His testimonies
They do no iniquity;
You have ordained Your precepts,
Oh, that my ways were committed
Then I would not be ashamed
I will praise You with an upright heart
I will keep Your statutes;
How can a young man keep his way pure?
With all my heart I have sought You;
I have hidden Your word in my heart
Blessed are You, O LORD;
With my lips I proclaim
I rejoice in the way of Your testimonies
I will meditate on Your precepts
I will delight in Your statutes;
Deal bountifully with Your servant,
Open my eyes that I may see
I am a stranger on the earth;
My soul is consumed with longing
You rebuke the arrogant —
Remove my scorn and contempt,
Though rulers sit and slander me,
Your testimonies are indeed my delight;
My soul cleaves to the dust;
I recounted my ways, and You answered me;
Make clear to me the way of Your precepts;
My soul melts with sorrow;
Remove me from the path of deceit
I have chosen the way of truth;
I cling to Your testimonies, O LORD;
I run in the path of Your commandments,
Teach me, O LORD, the way of Your statutes,
Give me understanding that I may obey Your law,
Direct me in the path of Your commandments,
Turn my heart to Your testimonies
Turn my eyes away from worthless things;
Establish Your word to Your servant,
Turn away the disgrace I dread,
How I long for Your precepts!
May Your loving devotion come to me, O LORD,
Then I can answer him who taunts,
Never take Your word of truth from my mouth,
I will always obey Your law,
And I will walk in freedom,
I will speak of Your testimonies before kings,
I delight in Your commandments
I lift up my hands to Your commandments, which I love,
Remember Your word to Your servant,
This is my comfort in affliction,
The arrogant utterly deride me,
I remember Your judgments of old, O LORD,
Rage has taken hold of me
Your statutes are songs to me
In the night, O LORD, I remember Your name,
This is my practice,
The LORD is my portion;
I have sought Your face with all my heart;
I considered my ways
I hurried without hesitating
Though the ropes of the wicked bind me,
At midnight I rise to give You thanks
I am a friend to all who fear You,
The earth is filled with Your loving devotion, O LORD;
You are good to Your servant, O LORD,
Teach me good judgment and knowledge,
Before I was afflicted, I went astray;
You are good, and You do what is good;
Though the arrogant have smeared me with lies,
Their hearts are callous and insensitive,
It was good for me to be afflicted,
The law from Your mouth is more precious to me
Your hands have made me and fashioned me;
May those who fear You see me and rejoice,
I know, O LORD, that Your judgments are righteous,
May Your loving devotion comfort me, I pray,
May Your compassion come to me, that I may live,
May the arrogant be put to shame for subverting me with a lie;
May those who fear You turn to me,
May my heart be blameless in Your statutes,
My soul faints for Your salvation;
My eyes fail, looking for Your promise;
Though I am like a wineskin dried up by smoke,
How many days must Your servant wait?
The arrogant have dug pits for me
All Your commandments are faithful;
They almost wiped me from the earth,
Revive me according to Your loving devotion,
Your word, O LORD, is everlasting;
Your faithfulness continues through all generations;
Your ordinances stand to this day,
If Your law had not been my delight,
I will never forget Your precepts,
I am Yours; save me,
The wicked wait to destroy me,
I have seen a limit to all perfection,
Oh, how I love Your law!
Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies,
I have more insight than all my teachers,
I discern more than the elders,
I have kept my feet from every evil path,
I have not departed from Your ordinances,
How sweet are Your words to my taste—
I gain understanding from Your precepts;
Your word is a lamp to my feet
I have sworn and confirmed
I am severely afflicted, O LORD;
Accept the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD,
I constantly take my life in my hands,
The wicked have set a snare for me,
Your testimonies are my heritage forever,
I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes,
The double-minded I despise,
You are my hiding place and my shield;
Depart from me, you evildoers,
Sustain me as You promised, that I may live;
Uphold me, and I will be saved,
You reject all who stray from Your statutes,
All the wicked on earth You discard like dross;
My flesh trembles in awe of You;
I have done what is just and right;
Ensure Your servant’s well-being;
My eyes fail, looking for Your salvation,
Deal with Your servant according to Your loving devotion,
I am Your servant; give me understanding,
It is time for the LORD to act,
Therefore I love Your commandments more than gold,
Therefore I admire all Your precepts
Wonderful are Your testimonies;
The unfolding of Your words gives light;
I open my mouth and pant,
Turn to me and show me mercy,
Order my steps in Your word;
Redeem me from the oppression of man,
Make Your face shine upon Your servant,
My eyes shed streams of tears
Righteous are You, O LORD,
The testimonies You have laid down are righteous
My zeal has consumed me
Your promise is completely pure;
I am lowly and despised,
Your righteousness is everlasting
Trouble and distress have found me,
Your testimonies are righteous forever.
I call with all my heart; answer me, O LORD!
I call to You; save me,
I rise before dawn and cry for help;
My eyes anticipate the watches of night,
Hear my voice, O LORD, according to Your loving devotion;
Those who follow after wickedness draw near;
You are near, O LORD,
Long ago I learned from Your testimonies
Look upon my affliction and rescue me,
Defend my cause and redeem me;
Salvation is far from the wicked
Great are Your mercies, O LORD;
Though my persecutors and foes are many,
I look on the faithless with loathing
Consider how I love Your precepts, O LORD;
The entirety of Your word is truth,
Rulers persecute me without cause,
I rejoice in Your promise
I hate and abhor falsehood,
Seven times a day I praise You
Abundant peace belongs to those who love Your law;
I wait for Your salvation, O LORD,
I obey Your testimonies
I obey Your precepts and Your testimonies,
May my cry come before You, O LORD;
May my plea come before You;
My lips pour forth praise,
My tongue sings of Your word,
May Your hand be ready to help me,
I long for Your salvation, O LORD,
Let me live to praise You;
I have strayed like a lost sheep;
