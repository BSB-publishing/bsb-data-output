A Psalm of David, for remembrance.
For Your arrows have pierced me deeply,
There is no soundness in my body
For my iniquities have overwhelmed me;
My wounds are foul and festering
I am bent and brought low;
For my loins are full of burning pain,
I am numb and badly crushed;
O Lord, my every desire is before You;
My heart pounds, my strength fails,
My beloved and friends shun my disease,
Those who seek my life lay snares;
But like a deaf man, I do not hear;
I am like a man who cannot hear,
I wait for You, O LORD;
For I said, “Let them not gloat over me —
For I am ready to fall,
Yes, I confess my iniquity;
Many are my enemies without cause,
Those who repay my good with evil
Do not forsake me, O LORD;
Come quickly to help me,
