A Psalm of Asaph.
But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled;
For I envied the arrogant
They have no struggle in their death;
They are free of the burdens others carry;
Therefore pride is their necklace;
From their prosperity proceeds iniquity;
They mock and speak with malice;
They set their mouths against the heavens,
So their people
The wicked say, “How can God know?
Behold, these are the wicked —
Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure;
For I am afflicted all day long
If I had said, “I will speak this way,”
When I tried to understand all this,
until I entered God’s sanctuary;
Surely You set them on slick ground;
How suddenly they are laid waste,
Like one waking from a dream,
When my heart was grieved
I was senseless and ignorant;
Yet I am always with You;
You guide me with Your counsel,
Whom have I in heaven but You?
My flesh and my heart may fail,
Those far from You will surely perish;
But as for me, it is good to draw near to God.
