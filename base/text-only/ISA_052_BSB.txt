Awake, awake,
Shake off your dust!
For this is what the LORD says:
For this is what the Lord GOD says:
And now what have I here?
Therefore My people will know My name;
How beautiful on the mountains
Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices,
Break forth in joy, sing together,
The LORD has bared His holy arm
Depart, depart, go out from there!
For you will not leave in a hurry
Behold, My Servant will prosper;
Just as many were appalled at Him
so He will sprinkle
