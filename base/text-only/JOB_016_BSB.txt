Then Job answered:
“I have heard many things like these;
Is there no end to your long-winded speeches?
I could also speak like you
But I would encourage you with my mouth,
Even if I speak, my pain is not relieved,
Surely He has now exhausted me;
You have bound me, and it has become a witness;
His anger has torn me and opposed me;
They open their mouths against me
God has delivered me to unjust men;
I was at ease, but He shattered me;
His archers surround me.
He breaks me with wound upon wound;
I have sewn sackcloth over my skin;
My face is red with weeping,
yet my hands are free of violence
O earth, do not cover my blood;
Even now my witness is in heaven,
My friends are my scoffers
Oh, that a man might plead with God
For when only a few years are past
