Hear the word that the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel.
This is what the LORD says:
For the customs of the peoples are worthless;
They adorn it with silver and gold
Like scarecrows in a cucumber patch,
There is none like You, O LORD.
Who would not fear You, O King of nations?
But they are altogether senseless and foolish,
Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish,
But the LORD is the true God;
Thus you are to tell them: “These gods, who have made neither the heavens nor the earth, will perish from this earth and from under these heavens.”
The LORD made the earth by His power;
When He thunders,
Every man is senseless and devoid of knowledge;
They are worthless, a work to be mocked.
The Portion of Jacob is not like these,
Gather up your belongings from this land, you who live under siege.
For this is what the LORD says:
Woe to me because of my brokenness;
My tent is destroyed,
For the shepherds have become senseless;
Listen! The sound of a report is coming —
I know, O LORD, that a man’s way is not his own;
Correct me, O LORD,
Pour out Your wrath on the nations
