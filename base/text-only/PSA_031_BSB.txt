For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
Incline Your ear to me;
For You are my rock and my fortress;
You free me from the net laid out for me,
Into Your hands I commit my spirit;
I hate
I will be glad and rejoice in Your loving devotion,
You have not delivered me to the enemy;
Be merciful to me, O LORD,
For my life is consumed with grief
Among all my enemies I am a disgrace,
I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind.
For I hear the slander of many;
But I trust in You, O LORD;
My times are in Your hands;
Make Your face shine on Your servant;
O LORD, let me not be ashamed,
May lying lips be silenced —
How great is Your goodness
You hide them in the secret place of Your presence
Blessed be the LORD,
In my alarm I said,
Love the LORD, all His saints.
Be strong and courageous,
