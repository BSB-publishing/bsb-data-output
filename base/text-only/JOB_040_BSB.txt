And the LORD said to Job:
“Will the faultfinder contend with the Almighty?
Then Job answered the LORD:
“Behold, I am insignificant. How can I reply to You?
I have spoken once, but I have no answer —
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:
“Now brace yourself
Would you really annul My justice?
Do you have an arm like God’s?
Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor,
Unleash the fury of your wrath;
Look on every proud man and humble him;
Bury them together in the dust;
Then I will confess to you
Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you.
See the strength of his loins
His tail sways like a cedar;
His bones are tubes of bronze;
He is the foremost of God’s works;
The hills yield him their produce,
He lies under the lotus plants,
The lotus plants conceal him in their shade;
Though the river rages, Behemoth is unafraid;
Can anyone capture him as he looks on,
