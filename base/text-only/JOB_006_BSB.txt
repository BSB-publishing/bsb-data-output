Then Job replied:
“If only my grief could be weighed
For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas —
For the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me;
Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass,
Is tasteless food eaten without salt,
My soul refuses to touch them;
If only my request were granted
that God would be willing to crush me,
It still brings me comfort,
What strength do I have, that I should still hope?
Is my strength like that of stone,
Is there any help within me
A despairing man should have the kindness of his friend,
But my brothers are as faithless as wadis,
darkened because of the ice
but ceasing in the dry season
Caravans turn aside from their routes;
The caravans of Tema look for water;
They are confounded because they had hoped;
For now you are of no help;
Have I ever said, ‘Give me something;
deliver me from the hand of the enemy;
Teach me, and I will be silent.
How painful are honest words!
Do you intend to correct my words,
You would even cast lots for an orphan
But now, please look at me.
Reconsider; do not be unjust.
Is there iniquity on my tongue?
