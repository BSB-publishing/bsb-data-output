I am a rose of Sharon,
Like a lily among the thorns
Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest
He has brought me to the house of wine,
Sustain me with raisins;
His left hand is under my head,
O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you
Listen! My beloved approaches.
My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.
My beloved calls to me,
For now the winter is past;
The flowers have appeared in the countryside;
The fig tree ripens its figs;
O my dove in the clefts of the rock,
Catch for us the foxes—
My beloved is mine and I am his;
Before the day breaks and shadows flee,
