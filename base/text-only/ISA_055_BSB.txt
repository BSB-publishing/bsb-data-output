“Come, all you who are thirsty,
Why spend money on that which is not bread,
Incline your ear and come to Me;
Behold, I have made him a witness to the nations,
Surely you will summon a nation you do not know,
Seek the LORD while He may be found;
Let the wicked man forsake his way
“For My thoughts are not your thoughts,
“For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
For just as rain and snow fall from heaven
so My word that proceeds from My mouth
You will indeed go out with joy
Instead of the thornbush, the cypress
