This is the burden against the Desert by the Sea:
A dire vision is declared to me:
Therefore my body is filled with anguish.
My heart falters;
They prepare a table, they lay out a carpet,
For this is what the Lord says to me:
When he sees chariots with teams of horsemen,
Then the lookout
Look, here come the riders,
O my people, crushed on the threshing floor,
This is the burden against Dumah:
The watchman replies,
This is the burden against Arabia:
Bring water for the thirsty,
For they flee from the sword—
For this is what the Lord says to me: “Within one year, as a hired worker would count it, all the glory of Kedar will be gone.
The remaining archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few.”
