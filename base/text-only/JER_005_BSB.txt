“Go up and down the streets of Jerusalem.
Although they say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives,’
O LORD, do not Your eyes look for truth?
Then I said,  “They are only the poor;
I will go to the powerful
Therefore a lion from the forest will strike them down,
“Why should I forgive you?
They are well-fed, lusty stallions,
Should I not punish them for these things?”
Go up through her vineyards and ravage them,
For the house of Israel and the house of Judah
They have lied about the LORD and said:
The prophets are but wind,
Therefore this is what the LORD God of Hosts says:
Behold, I am bringing a distant nation against you,
Their quivers are like open graves;
They will devour your harvest and food;
“Yet even in those days,” declares the LORD, “I will not make a full end of you.
And when the people ask, ‘For what offense has the LORD our God done all these things to us?’ You are to tell them, ‘Just as you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land, so will you serve foreigners in a land that is not your own.’”
Declare this in the house of Jacob and proclaim it in Judah:
“Hear this,
Do you not fear Me?”
But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts.
They have not said in their hearts,
Your iniquities have diverted these from you;
For among My people are wicked men;
Like cages full of birds,
They have grown fat and sleek,
Should I not punish them for these things?”
A horrible and shocking thing
The prophets prophesy falsely,
