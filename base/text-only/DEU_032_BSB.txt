Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak;
Let my teaching fall like rain
For I will proclaim the name of the LORD.
He is the Rock, His work is perfect;
His people have acted corruptly toward Him;
Is this how you repay the LORD,
Remember the days of old;
When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,
But the LORD’s portion is His people,
He found him in a desert land,
As an eagle stirs up its nest
The LORD alone led him,
He made him ride on the heights of the land
with curds from the herd and milk from the flock,
But Jeshurun
They provoked His jealousy with foreign gods;
They sacrificed to demons, not to God,
You ignored the Rock who brought you forth;
When the LORD saw this, He rejected them,
He said: “I will hide My face from them;
They have provoked My jealousy by that which is not God;
For a fire has been kindled by My anger,
I will heap disasters upon them;
They will be wasted from hunger
Outside, the sword will take their children,
I would have said that I would cut them to pieces
if I had not dreaded the taunt of the enemy,
Israel is a nation devoid of counsel,
If only they were wise, they would understand it;
How could one man pursue a thousand,
For their rock is not like our Rock,
But their vine is from the vine of Sodom
Their wine is the venom of serpents,
“Have I not stored up these things,
Vengeance is Mine; I will repay.
For the LORD will vindicate His people
He will say: “Where are their gods,
which ate the fat of their sacrifices
See now that I am He;
For I lift up My hand to heaven and declare:
when I sharpen My flashing sword,
I will make My arrows drunk with blood,
Rejoice, O heavens, with Him,
Then Moses came with Joshua
When Moses had finished reciting all these words to all Israel,
he said to them, “Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to carefully follow all the words of this law.
For they are not idle words to you, because they are your life, and by them you will live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”
On that same day the LORD said to Moses,
“Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo, in the land of Moab across from Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites as their own possession.
And there on the mountain that you climb, you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.
For at the waters of Meribah-kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin, both of you broke faith with Me among the Israelites by failing to treat Me as holy in their presence.
Although you shall see from a distance the land that I am giving the Israelites, you shall not enter it.”
