Of David.
Bless the LORD, O my soul,
He who forgives all your iniquities
who redeems your life from the Pit
who satisfies you with good things,
The LORD executes righteousness
He made known His ways to Moses,
The LORD is compassionate and gracious,
He will not always accuse us,
He has not dealt with us according to our sins
For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
As far as the east is from the west,
As a father has compassion on his children,
For He knows our frame;
As for man, his days are like grass—
when the wind passes over, it vanishes,
But from everlasting to everlasting
to those who keep His covenant
The LORD has established His throne in heaven,
Bless the LORD, all His angels mighty in strength
Bless the LORD, all His hosts,
Bless the LORD, all His works
