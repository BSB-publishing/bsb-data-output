This is the word of the LORD that came to Joel son of Pethuel:
Hear this, O elders;
Tell it to your children;
What the devouring locust has left,
Wake up, you drunkards, and weep;
For a nation has invaded My land,
It has laid waste My grapevine
Wail like a virgin dressed in sackcloth,
Grain and drink offerings have been cut off
The field is ruined;
Be dismayed, O farmers,
The grapevine is dried up,
Put on sackcloth and lament, O priests;
Consecrate a fast;
Alas for the day!
Has not the food been cut off
The seeds lie shriveled beneath the clods;
How the cattle groan!
To You, O LORD, I call,
Even the beasts of the field pant for You,
