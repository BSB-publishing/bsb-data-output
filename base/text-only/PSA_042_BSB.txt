For the choirmaster. A Maskil of the sons of Korah.
My soul thirsts for God, the living God.
My tears have been my food
These things come to mind as I pour out my soul:
Why are you downcast, O my soul?
O my God, my soul despairs within me.
Deep calls to deep
The LORD decrees His loving devotion by day,
I say to God my Rock,
Like the crushing of my bones,
Why are you downcast, O my soul?
