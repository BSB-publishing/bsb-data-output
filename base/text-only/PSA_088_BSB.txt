A song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. For the choirmaster. According to Mahalath Leannoth.
May my prayer come before You;
For my soul is full of troubles,
I am counted among those descending to the Pit.
I am forsaken among the dead,
You have laid me in the lowest Pit,
Your wrath weighs heavily upon me;
You have removed my friends from me;
My eyes grow dim with grief.
Do You work wonders for the dead?
Can Your loving devotion be proclaimed in the grave,
Will Your wonders be known in the darkness,
But to You, O LORD, I cry for help;
Why, O LORD, do You reject me?
From my youth I was afflicted and near death.
Your wrath has swept over me;
All day long they engulf me like water;
You have removed my beloved and my friend;
