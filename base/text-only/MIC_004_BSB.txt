In the last days the mountain of the house of the LORD
And many nations will come and say:
Then He will judge between many peoples
And each man will sit under his own vine
Though all the nations
“On that day,” declares the LORD,
And I will make the lame into a remnant,
And you, O watchtower of the flock,
Why do you now cry aloud?
Writhe in agony, O Daughter of Zion,
But now many nations
But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD
Rise and thresh, O Daughter of Zion,
