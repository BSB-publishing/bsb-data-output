Bless the LORD, O my soul!
He wraps Himself in light as with a garment;
laying the beams of His chambers
He makes the winds His messengers,
He set the earth on its foundations,
You covered it with the deep like a garment;
At Your rebuke the waters fled;
the mountains rose and the valleys sank
You set a boundary they cannot cross,
He sends forth springs in the valleys;
They give drink to every beast of the field;
The birds of the air nest beside the springs;
He waters the mountains from His chambers;
He makes the grass grow for the livestock
wine that gladdens the heart of man,
The trees of the LORD have their fill,
where the birds build their nests;
The high mountains are for the wild goats,
He made the moon to mark the seasons;
You bring darkness, and it becomes night,
The young lions roar for their prey
The sun rises, and they withdraw;
Man goes forth to his work
How many are Your works, O LORD!
Here is the sea, vast and wide,
There the ships pass,
All creatures look to You
When You give it to them,
When You hide Your face,
When You send Your Spirit,
May the glory of the LORD endure forever;
He looks on the earth,
I will sing to the LORD all my life;
May my meditation be pleasing to Him,
May sinners vanish from the earth
