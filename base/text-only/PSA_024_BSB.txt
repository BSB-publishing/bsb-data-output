A Psalm of David.
For He has founded it upon the seas
Who may ascend the hill of the LORD?
He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
He will receive blessing from the LORD
Such is the generation of those who seek Him,
Lift up your heads, O gates!
Who is this King of Glory?
Lift up your heads, O gates!
Who is He, this King of Glory?
