For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
You know when I sit and when I rise;
You search out my path and my lying down;
Even before a word is on my tongue,
You hem me in behind and before;
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
Where can I go to escape Your Spirit?
If I ascend to the heavens, You are there;
If I rise on the wings of the dawn,
even there Your hand will guide me;
If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me,
even the darkness is not dark to You,
For You formed my inmost being;
I praise You,
My frame was not hidden from You
Your eyes saw my unformed body;
How precious to me are Your thoughts,
If I were to count them,
O God, that You would slay the wicked—
who speak of You deceitfully;
Do I not hate those who hate You, O LORD,
I hate them with perfect hatred;
Search me, O God, and know my heart;
See if there is any offensive way in me;
