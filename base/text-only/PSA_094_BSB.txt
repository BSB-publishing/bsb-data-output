O LORD, God of vengeance,
Rise up, O Judge of the earth;
How long will the wicked, O LORD,
They pour out arrogant words;
They crush Your people, O LORD;
They kill the widow and the foreigner;
They say, “The LORD does not see;
Take notice, O senseless among the people!
He who affixed the ear, can He not hear?
He who admonishes the nations, does He not discipline?
The LORD knows the thoughts of man,
Blessed is the man You discipline, O LORD,
to grant him relief from days of trouble,
For the LORD will not forsake His people;
Surely judgment will again be righteous,
Who will rise up for me against the wicked?
Unless the LORD had been my helper,
If I say, “My foot is slipping,”
When anxiety overwhelms me,
Can a corrupt throne be Your ally —
They band together against the righteous
But the LORD has been my stronghold,
He will bring upon them their own iniquity
