Who is this coming from Edom,
Why are Your clothes red,
“I have trodden the winepress alone,
For the day of vengeance was in My heart,
I looked, but there was no one to help;
I trampled the nations in My anger;
I will make known the LORD’s loving devotion
For He said, “They are surely My people,
In all their distress, He too was afflicted,
But they rebelled
Then His people remembered the days of old,
who sent His glorious arm
who led them through the depths
Like cattle going down to the valley,
Look down from heaven and see,
Yet You are our Father,
Why, O LORD, do You make us stray from Your ways
For a short while Your people possessed Your holy place,
We have become like those You never ruled,
