And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Son of man, set your face against Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel
and tell her that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am against you, and I will draw My sword from its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.
Because I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked, My sword will be unsheathed against everyone from south to north.
Then all flesh will know that I, the LORD, have taken My sword from its sheath, not to return it again.’
But you, son of man, groan! Groan before their eyes with a broken heart and bitter grief.
And when they ask, ‘Why are you groaning?’ you are to say, ‘Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt, and every hand will go limp. Every spirit will faint, and every knee will turn to water.’ Yes, it is coming and it will surely happen, declares the Lord GOD.”
Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Son of man, prophesy and tell them that this is what the Lord says:
it is sharpened for the slaughter,
The sword is appointed to be polished,
Cry out and wail,
Surely testing will come!
‘So then, son of man,
So that their hearts may melt
Slash to the right;
I too will strike My hands together,
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Now you, son of man, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to take, both starting from the same land. And make a signpost where the road branches off to each city.
Mark out one road for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and another against Judah into fortified Jerusalem.
For the king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road, at the junction of the two roads, to seek an omen: He shakes the arrows, he consults the idols, he examines the liver.
In his right hand appears the portent for Jerusalem, where he is to set up battering rams, to call for the slaughter, to lift a battle cry, to direct the battering rams against the gates, to build a ramp, and to erect a siege wall.
It will seem like a false omen to the eyes of those who have sworn allegiance to him, but it will draw attention to their guilt and take them captive.
Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you have drawn attention to your guilt, exposing your transgressions, so that your sins are revealed in all your deeds — because you have come to remembrance — you shall be taken in hand.
And you, O profane and wicked prince of Israel,
This is what the Lord GOD says:
A ruin, a ruin,
Now prophesy, son of man, and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says concerning the Ammonites and their contempt:
while they offer false visions for you
Return the sword to its sheath!
I will pour out My anger upon you;
You will be fuel for the fire.
