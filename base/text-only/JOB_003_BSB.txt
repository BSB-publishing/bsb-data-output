After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
And this is what he said:
“May the day of my birth perish,
If only that day had turned to darkness!
May darkness and gloom reclaim it,
If only darkness had taken that night away!
Behold, may that night be barren;
May it be cursed by those who curse the day
May its morning stars grow dark;
For that night did not shut the doors of the womb
Why did I not perish at birth;
Why were there knees to receive me,
For now I would be lying down in peace;
with kings and counselors of the earth,
or with princes who had gold,
Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child,
There the wicked cease from raging,
The captives enjoy their ease;
Both small and great are there,
Why is light given to the miserable,
who long for death that does not come,
who rejoice and greatly exult
Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden,
I sigh when food is put before me,
For the thing I feared has overtaken me,
I am not at ease or quiet;
