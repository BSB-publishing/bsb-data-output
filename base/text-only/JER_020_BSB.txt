When Pashhur the priest, the son of Immer and the chief official in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things,
he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.
The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The LORD does not call you Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.
For this is what the LORD says: ‘I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies before your very eyes. And I will hand Judah over to the king of Babylon, and he will carry them away to Babylon and put them to the sword.
I will give away all the wealth of this city — all its products and valuables, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah — to their enemies. They will plunder them, seize them, and carry them off to Babylon.
And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon, and there you will die and be buried — you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied these lies.’”
You have deceived me, O LORD, and I was deceived.
For whenever I speak, I cry out;
If I say, “I will not mention Him
For I have heard the whispering of many:
But the LORD is with me like a fearsome warrior.
O LORD of Hosts, who examines the righteous,
Sing to the LORD!
Cursed be the day I was born!
Cursed be the man who brought my father the news,
May that man be like the cities
because he did not kill me in the womb
Why did I come out of the womb
