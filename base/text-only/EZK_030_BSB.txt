Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Son of man, prophesy and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says:
For the day is near,
A sword will come against Egypt,
Cush, Put, and Lud,
For this is what the LORD says:
They will be desolate among desolate lands,
Then they will know that I am the LORD
On that day messengers will go out from Me in ships to frighten Cush out of complacency. Anguish will come upon them on the day of Egypt’s doom.
This is what the Lord GOD says:
He and his people with him,
I will make the streams dry up
This is what the Lord GOD says:
I will lay waste Pathros,
I will pour out My wrath on Pelusium,
I will set fire to Egypt,
The young men of On and Pi-beseth
The day will be darkened in Tahpanhes
So I will execute judgment on Egypt,
In the eleventh year, on the seventh day of the first month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. See, it has not been bound up for healing, or splinted for strength to hold the sword.
Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt. I will break his arms, both the strong one and the one already broken, and will make the sword fall from his hand.
I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.
I will strengthen the arms of Babylon’s king and place My sword in his hand, but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, who will groan before him like a mortally wounded man.
I will strengthen the arms of Babylon’s king, but Pharaoh’s arms will fall limp.
I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands. Then they will know that I am the LORD.”
