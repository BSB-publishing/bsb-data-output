When Ephraim
Now they sin more and more
Therefore they will be like the morning mist,
Yet I am the LORD your God
I knew you in the wilderness,
When they had pasture,
So like a lion I will pounce on them;
Like a bear robbed of her cubs I will attack them,
You are destroyed, O Israel,
Where is your king now
So in My anger I gave you a king,
The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up;
Labor pains come upon him,
I will ransom them from the power of Sheol;
Although he flourishes among his brothers,
Samaria will bear her guilt
