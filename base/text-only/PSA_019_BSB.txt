For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David.
Day after day they pour forth speech;
Without speech or language,
their voice
Like a bridegroom emerging from his chamber,
it rises at one end of the heavens
The Law of the LORD is perfect,
The precepts of the LORD are right,
The fear of the LORD is pure,
They are more precious than gold,
By them indeed Your servant is warned;
Who can discern his own errors?
Keep Your servant also from willful sins;
May the words of my mouth
